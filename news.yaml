         Data makes science possible. Sharing data improves visibility, and makes the research process transparent. This increases trust in the work, and allows for independent reproduction of results. However, a large proportion of data from published research is often only available to the original authors. Despite the obvious benefits of sharing data, and scientists' advocating for the importance of sharing data, most advice on sharing data discusses its broader benefits, rather than the practical considerations of sharing. This paper provides practical, actionable advice on how to actually share data alongside research. The key message is sharing data falls on a continuum, and entering it should come with minimal barriers.

    Scientific reproducibility is essential for the advancement of science. It allows the results of previous studies to be reproduced, validates their conclusions and develops new contributions based on previous research. Nowadays, more and more authors consider that the ultimate product of academic research is the scientific manuscript, together with all the necessary elements (i.e., code and data) so that others can reproduce the results. However, there are numerous difficulties for some studies to be reproduced easily (i.e., biased results, the pressure to publish, and proprietary data). In this context, we explain our experience in an attempt to improve the reproducibility of a GIScience project. According to our project needs, we evaluated a list of practices, standards and tools that may facilitate open and reproducible research in the geospatial domain, contextualising them on Peng’s reproducibility spectrum. Among these resources, we focused on containerisation technologies and performed a shallow review to reflect on the level of adoption of these technologies in combination with OSGeo software. Finally, containerisation technologies proved to enhance the reproducibility and we used UML diagrams to describe representative work-flows deployed in our GIScience project.

   The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Music Recommendation: A Reproducibility Study

description: |
   Research has shown that recommender systems are typically biased towards popular items, which leads to less popular items being underrepresented in recommendations. The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user groups from the LastFM music platform that are categorized based on how much their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all LastFM users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for LastFM than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the LastFM dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess group significantly receives the worst recommendations.

   Funding agencies increasingly ask applicants to include data and software management plans into proposals. In addition, the author guidelines of scientific journals and conferences more often include a statement on data availability, and some reviewers reject unreproducible submissions. This trend towards open science increases the pressure on authors to provide access to the source code and data underlying the computational results in their scientific papers. Still, publishing reproducible articles is a demanding task and not achieved simply by providing access to code scripts and data files. Consequently, several projects develop solutions to support the publication of executable analyses alongside articles considering the needs of the aforementioned stakeholders. The key contribution of this paper is a review of applications addressing the issue of publishing executable computational research results. We compare the approaches across properties relevant for the involved stakeholders, e.g., provided features and deployment options, and also critically discuss trends and limitations. The review can support publishers to decide which system to integrate into their submission process, editors to recommend tools for researchers, and authors of scientific papers to adhere to reproducibility principles.

   Current norms for the teaching and mentoring of higher education are rooted in obsolete practices of bygone eras. Improving the transparency and rigor of science is the responsibility of all who engage in it. Ongoing attempts to improve research credibility have, however, neglected an essential aspect of the academic cycle: the training of researchers and consumers of research. Principled teaching and mentoring involve imparting students with an understanding of research findings in light of epistemic uncertainty, and moreover, an appreciation of best practices in the production of knowledge. We introduce a Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT). Its main goal is to provide educators with a pathway towards the incremental adoption of principled teaching and mentoring practices, including open and reproducible research. FORRT will act as an initiative to support instructors, collating existing teaching pedagogies and materials to be reused and adapted for use within new and existing courses. Moreover, FORRT can be used as a tool to benchmark the current level of training students receive across six clusters of open and reproducible research practices: 'reproducibility and replicability knowledge', 'conceptual and statistical knowledge', 'reproducible analyses', 'preregistration', 'open data and materials', and 'replication research'. FORRT will strive to be an advocate for the establishment of principled teaching and mentorship as a fourth pillar of a true scientific utopia.[working document here: https://tinyurl.com/FORRTworkingDOC]

description: |
   The adoption of reproducibility remains low, despite incentives becoming increasingly common in different domains, conferences, and journals. The truth is, reproducibility is technically difficult to achieve due to the complexities of computational environments. To address these technical challenges, we created ReproZip, an open-source tool that automatically packs research along with all the necessary information to reproduce it, including data files, software, OS version, and environment variables. Everything is then bundled into an rpz file, which users can use to reproduce the work with ReproZip and a suitable unpacker (e.g.: using Vagrant or Docker). The rpz file is general and contains rich metadata: more unpackers can be added as needed, better guaranteeing long-term preservation. However, installing the unpackers can still be burdensome for secondary users of ReproZip bundles. In this paper, we will discuss how ReproZip and our new tool, ReproServer, can be used together to facilitate access to well-preserved, reproducible work. ReproServer is a web application that allows users to upload or provide a link to a ReproZip bundle, and then interact with/reproduce the contents from the comfort of their browser. Users are then provided a persistent link to the unpacked work on ReproServer which they can share with reviewers or colleagues.

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
   Recently, many workflows and tools that aim to increase the reproducibility and replicability of research findings have been suggested. In this review, we discuss the opportunities that these efforts offer for the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience. We focus on issues broadly related to statistical power and to flexibility and transparency in data analyses. Critical considerations relating to statistical power include challenges in recruitment and testing of young populations, how to increase the value of studies with small samples, and the opportunities and challenges related to working with large-scale datasets. Developmental studies also involve challenges such as choices about age groupings, modelling across the lifespan, the analyses of longitudinal changes, and neuroimaging data that can be processed and analyzed in a multitude of ways. Flexibility in data acquisition, analyses and description may thereby greatly impact results. We discuss methods for improving transparency in developmental cognitive neuroscience, and how preregistration of studies can improve methodological rigor in the field. While outlining challenges and issues that may arise before, during, and after data collection, solutions and resources are highlighted aiding to overcome some of these. Since the number of useful tools and techniques is ever-growing, we highlight the fact that many practices can be implemented stepwise.

   Use of study design principles would increase the reproducibility of reviews in conservation biology

description: |
   Despite the importance of reviews and syntheses in advancing our understanding of the natural world and informing conservation policy, they frequently are not conducted with the same careful methods as primary studies. This discrepancy can lead to controversy over review conclusions because the methods employed to gather evidence supporting the conclusions are not reproducible. To illustrate this problem, we assessed whether the methods of reviews involved in two recent controversies met the common scientific standard of being reported in sufficient detail to be repeated by an independent researcher. We found that none of the reviews were repeatable by this standard. Later stages of the review process, such as quantitative analyses, were generally described well, but the more fundamental, data-gathering stage was not fully described in any of the reviews. To address the irreproducibility of review conclusions, we believe that ecologists and conservation biologists should recognize that literature searches for reviews are a data gathering exercise and apply the same rigorous study design principles and reporting standards that they would use for primary studies.

description: |
   Multiple mazes are routinely used to test the performance of animals because each has disadvantages inherent to its shape. However, the maze shape cannot be flexibly and rapidly reproduced in a repeatable and scalable way in a single environment. Here, to overcome the lack of flexibility, scalability, reproducibility and repeatability, we develop a reconfigurable maze system that consists of interlocking runways and an array of accompanying parts. It allows experimenters to rapidly and flexibly configure a variety of maze structures along the grid pattern in a repeatable and scalable manner. Spatial navigational behavior and hippocampal place coding were not impaired by the interlocking mechanism. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we demonstrate that the maze morphing induces location remapping of the spatial receptive field. The reconfigurable maze thus provides flexibility, scalability, repeatability, and reproducibility, therefore facilitating consistent investigation into the neuronal substrates for learning and memory and allowing screening for behavioral phenotypes.

     A study of 100 papers from five journals that make use of bioacoustic recordings shows that only a minority (21%) deposit any of the recordings in a repository, supplementary materials section or a personal website. This lack of deposition hinders re-use of the raw data by other researchers, prevents the reproduction of a project's analyses and confirmation of its findings and impedes progress within the broader bioacoustics community. We make some recommendations for researchers interested in depositing their data.

I will mainly address the first two here, proposing a praxis of reproducible computational science.

     Reporting specific modelling methods and metadata is essential to the reproducibility of ecological studies, yet guidelines rarely exist regarding what information should be noted. Here, we address this issue for ecological niche modelling or species distribution modelling, a rapidly developing toolset in ecology used across many aspects of biodiversity science. Our quantitative review of the recent literature reveals a general lack of sufficient information to fully reproduce the work. Over two-thirds of the examined studies neglected to report the version or access date of the underlying data, and only half reported model parameters. To address this problem, we propose adopting a checklist to guide studies in reporting at least the minimum information necessary for ecological niche modelling reproducibility, offering a straightforward way to balance efficiency and accuracy. We encourage the ecological niche modelling community, as well as journal reviewers and editors, to utilize and further develop this framework to facilitate and improve the reproducibility of future work. The proposed checklist framework is generalizable to other areas of ecology, especially those utilizing biodiversity data, environmental data and statistical modelling, and could also be adopted by a broader array of disciplines.

     The Reproducibility issue even if not a crisis, is still a major problem in the world of science and engineering. Within metrology, making measurements at the limits that science allows for, inevitably, factors not originally considered relevant can be very relevant. Who did the measurement? How exactly did they do it? Was a mistake made? Was the equipment working correctly? All these factors can influence the outputs from a measurement process. In this work we investigate the use of Semantic Web technologies as a strategic basis on which to capture provenance meta-data and the data curation processes that will lead to a better understanding of issues affecting reproducibility.

     Reproducibility is a fundamental requirement of the scientific process since it enables outcomes to be replicated and verified. Computational scientific experiments can benefit from improved reproducibility for many reasons, including validation of results and reuse by other scientists. However, designing reproducible experiments remains a challenge and hence the need for developing methodologies and tools that can support this process. Here, we propose a conceptual model for reproducibility to specify its main attributes and properties, along with a framework that allows for computational experiments to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. We present a case study in ecological niche modeling to demonstrate and evaluate the implementation of this framework.

      Geoinformatics deals with spatial and temporal information and its analysis. Research in this field often follows established practices of first developing computational solutions for specific spatiotemporal problems and then publishing the results and insights in a (static) paper, e.g. as a PDF. Not every detail can be included in such a paper, and particularly, the complete set of computational steps are frequently left out. While this approach conveys key knowledge to other researchers it makes it difficult to effectively re-use and reproduce the reported results. In this vision paper, we propose an alternative approach to carry out and report research in Geoinformatics. It is based on (computational) reproducibility, promises to make re-use and reproduction more effective, and creates new opportunities for further research. We report on experiences with executable research compendia (ERCs) as alternatives to classic publications in Geoinformatics, and we discuss how ERCs combined with a supporting research infrastructure can transform how we do research in Geoinformatics. We point out which challenges this idea entails and what new research opportunities emerge, in particular for the COSIT community.

     Shared scientific resources, also known as core facilities, support a significant portion of the research conducted at biomolecular research institutions. The Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) established the Committee on Core Rigor and Reproducibility (CCoRRe) to further its mission of integrating advanced technologies, education, and communication in the operations of shared scientific resources in support of reproducible research. In order to first assess the needs of the scientific shared resource community, the CCoRRe solicited feedback from ABRF members via a survey. The purpose of the survey was to gain information on how U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiatives on advancing scientific rigor and reproducibility influenced current services and new technology development. In addition, the survey aimed to identify the challenges and opportunities related to implementation of new reporting requirements and to identify new practices and resources needed to ensure rigorous research. The results revealed a surprising unfamiliarity with the NIH guidelines. Many of the perceived challenges to the effective implementation of best practices (i.e., those designed to ensure rigor and reproducibility) were similarly noted as a challenge to effective provision of support services in a core setting. Further, most cores routinely use best practices and offer services that support rigor and reproducibility. These services include access to well-maintained instrumentation and training on experimental design and data analysis as well as data management. Feedback from this survey will enable the ABRF to build better educational resources and share critical best-practice guidelines. These resources will become important tools to the core community and the researchers they serve to impact rigor and transparency across the range of science and technology.

     This data article introduces a reproducibility dataset with the aim of allowing the exact replication of all experiments, results and data tables introduced in our companion paper (Lastra-Díaz et al., 2019), which introduces the largest experimental survey on ontology-based semantic similarity methods and Word Embeddings (WE) for word similarity reported in the literature. The implementation of all our experiments, as well as the gathering of all raw data derived from them, was based on the software implementation and evaluation of all methods in HESML library (Lastra-Díaz et al., 2017), and their subsequent recording with Reprozip (Chirigati et al., 2016). Raw data is made up by a collection of data files gathering the raw word-similarity values returned by each method for each word pair evaluated in any benchmark. Raw data files was processed by running a R-language script with the aim of computing all evaluation metrics reported in (Lastra-Díaz et al., 2019), such as Pearson and Spearman correlation, harmonic score and statistical significance p-values, as well as to generate automatically all data tables shown in our companion paper. Our dataset provides all input data files, resources and complementary software tools to reproduce from scratch all our experimental data, statistical analysis and reported data. Finally, our reproducibility dataset provides a self-contained experimentation platform which allows to run new word similarity benchmarks by setting up new experiments including other unconsidered methods or word similarity benchmarks.

     Background:The complex nature of biological data has driven the development of specialized software tools. Scientificworkflow management systems simplify the assembly of such tools into pipelines, assist with job automation, and aidreproducibility of analyses. Many contemporary workflow tools are specialized or not designed for highly complexworkflows, such as with nested loops, dynamic scheduling, and parametrization, which is common in, e.g., machinelearning.Findings:SciPipe is a workflow programming library implemented in the programming language Go, for managingcomplex and dynamic pipelines in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and other fields. SciPipe helps in particular withworkflow constructs common in machine learning, such as extensive branching, parameter sweeps, and dynamicscheduling and parametrization of downstream tasks. SciPipe builds on flow-based programming principles to supportagile development of workflows based on a library of self-contained, reusable components. It supports running subsets ofworkflows for improved iterative development and provides a data-centric audit logging feature that saves a full audit tracefor every output file of a workflow, which can be converted to other formats such as HTML, TeX, and PDF on demand. Theutility of SciPipe is demonstrated with a machine learning pipeline, a genomics, and a transcriptomics pipeline.Conclusions:SciPipe provides a solution for agile development of complex and dynamic pipelines, especially in machinelearning, through a flexible application programming interface suitable for scientists used to programming or scripting.

     Foregrounding data curation to foster reproducibility of workflows and scientific data reuse

     Scientific data reuse requires careful curation and annotation of the data. Late stage curation activities foster FAIR principles which include metadata standards for making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. However, in scientific domains such as biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, there is a considerable time lag (usually more than a year) between data creation and data deposition. It is simply not feasible to backfill the required metadata so long after the data has been created (anything not carefully recorded is forgotten) – curation activities must begin closer to (if not at the point of) data creation. The need for foregrounding data curation activities is well known. However, scientific disciplines which rely on complex experimental design, sophisticated instrumentation, and intricate processing workflows, require extra care. The knowledge gap investigated by this research proposal is to identify classes of important metadata which are hidden within the tacit knowledge of a scientist when constructing an experiment, hidden within the operational specifications of the scientific instrumentation, and hidden within the design / execution of processing workflows. Once these classes of hidden knowledge have been identified, it will be possible to explore mechanisms for preventing the loss of key metadata, either through automated conversion from existing metadata or through curation activities at the time of data creation. The first step of the research plan is to survey artifacts of scientific data creation. That is, (i) existing data files with accompanying metadata, (ii) workflows and scripts for data processing, and (iii) documentation for software and scientific instrumentation. The second step is to group, categorize, and classify the types of "hidden" knowledge discovered. For example, one class of hidden knowledge already uncovered is the implicit recording of data as its reciprocal rather than the value itself, as in magnetogyric versus gyromagnetic ratios. The third step is to design/propose classes of solutions for these classes of problems. For instance, reciprocals are often helped by being explicit with units of measurement. Careful design of metadata display and curation widgets can help expose and document tacit knowledge which would otherwise be lost.

     Reproducible research into human semiochemical cues and pheromones: learning from psychology’s renaissance

description: |
     As with other mammals, smell in the form of semiochemicals is likely to influence the behaviour of humans, as olfactory cues to emotions, health, and mate choice. A subset of semiochemicals, pheromones, chemical signals within a species, have been identified in many mammal species. As mammals, we may have pheromones too. Sadly, the story of molecules claimed to be ‘putative human pheromones’ is a classic example of bad science carried out by good scientists. Much of human semiochemicals research including work on ‘human pheromones’ and olfactory cues comes within the field of psychology. Thus, the research is highly likely to be affected by the ‘reproducibility crisis’ in psychology and other life sciences. Psychology researchers have responded with proposals to enable better, more reliable science, with an emphasis on enhancing reproducibility. A key change is the adoption of study pre-registration which will also reduce publication bias. Human semiochemicals research would benefit from adopting these proposals.

     On the Index of Repeatability: Estimation and Sample Size Requirements

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
     Background: Repeatability is a statement on the magnitude of measurement error. When biomarkers are used for disease diagnoses, they should be measured accurately. Objectives: We derive an index of repeatability based on the ratio of two variance components. Estimation of the index is derived from the one-way Analysis of Variance table based on the one-way random effects model. We estimate the large sample variance of the estimator and assess its adequacy using bootstrap methods. An important requirement for valid estimation of repeatability is the availability of multiple observations on each subject taken by the same rater and under the same conditions. Methods: We use the delta method to derive the large sample variance of the estimate of repeatability index. The question related to the number of required repeats per subjects is answered by two methods. In first methods we estimate the number of repeats that minimizes the variance of the estimated repeatability index, and the second determine the number of repeats needed under cost-constraints. Results and Novel Contribution: The situation when the measurements do not follow Gaussian distribution will be dealt with. It is shown that the required sample size is quite sensitive to the relative cost. We illustrate the methodologies on the Serum Alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) available from hospital registry data for samples of males and females. Repeatability is higher among females in comparison to males.

    Background and aims: Credible research emphasizes transparency, openness, and reproducibility. These characteristics are fundamental to promoting and maintaining research integrity. This aim of this study was to evaluate the current state of transparency and reproducibility in the field of addiction science. Design: Cross-sectional design Measurements:  This study used the National Library of Medicine catalog to search for all journals using the subject terms tag: Substance-Related Disorders [ST]. Journals were then searched via PubMed in the timeframe of January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018 and 300 publications were randomly selected. A pilot-tested Google form containing reproducibility/transparency characteristics was used for data extraction by two investigators who performed this process in a duplicate and blinded fashion.  Findings: Slightly more than half of the publications were open access (152/293, 50.7%). Few publications had pre-registration (7/244, 2.87%), material availability (2/237, 1.23%), protocol availability (3/244 ,0.80%), data availability (28/244, 11.48%), and analysis script availability (2/244, 0.82%). Most publications provided a conflict of interest statement (221/293, 75.42%) and funding sources (268/293, 91.47%). One replication study was reported (1/244, 0.04%). Few publications were cited (64/238, 26.89%) and 0 were excluded from meta-analyses and/or systematic reviews. Conclusion: Our study found that current practices that promote transparency and reproducibility are lacking, and thus, there is much room for improvement. First, investigators should preregister studies prior to commencement. Researchers should also make the materials, data, analysis script publicly available. To foster reproducibility, individuals should remain transparent about funding sources for the project and financial conflicts of interest. Research stakeholders should work together toward improved solutions on these matters. With these protections in place, the field of addiction medicine can lead in dissemination of information necessary to treat patients.

    Crowdsourcing enables novel forms of research and knowledge production. It uses cyberspace to collect diverse research participants, coordinate projects and keep costs low. Recently social scientists began crowdsourcing their peers to engage in mass research targeting a specific topic. This enables meta-analysis of many analysts’ results obtained from a single crowdsourced research project, leading to exponential gains in credibility and scientific utility. Initial applications demonstrate positive returns for both original and replication research using various research instruments, and secondary or experimental data. It can provide more reliable Bayesian priors for selecting models and is an untapped mode of theory production that greatly benefit social science. Finally, in addition to the credibility and reproducibility gains, crowdsourcing embodies many core values of the Open Science Movement because it promotes community and equality among scientists.

    To identify families of experiments that used meta-analysis, to investigate their methods for effect size construction and aggregation, and to assess the reproducibility and validity of their results. We performed a systematic review (SR) of papers reporting families of experiments in high quality software engineering journals, that attempted to apply meta-analysis. We attempted to reproduce the reported meta-analysis results using the descriptive statistics and also investigated the validity of the meta-analysis process. Out of 13 identified primary studies, we reproduced only five. Seven studies could not be reproduced. One study which was correctly analyzed could not be reproduced due to rounding errors. When we were unable to reproduce results, we provide revised meta-analysis results. To support reproducibility of analyses presented in our paper, it is complemented by the reproducer R package. Meta-analysis is not well understood by software engineering researchers. To support novice researchers, we present recommendations for reporting and meta-analyzing families of experiments and a detailed example of how to analyze a family of 4-group crossover experiments.

    Human similarity and relatedness judgements between concepts underlie most of cognitive capabilities, such as categorisation, memory, decision-making and reasoning. For this reason, the proposal of methods for the estimation of the degree of similarity and relatedness between words and concepts has been a very active line of research in the fields of artificial intelligence, information retrieval and natural language processing among others. Main approaches proposed in the literature can be categorised in two large families as follows: (1) Ontology-based semantic similarity Measures (OM) and (2) distributional measures whose most recent and successful methods are based on Word Embedding (WE) models. However, the lack of a deep analysis of both families of methods slows down the advance of this line of research and its applications. This work introduces the largest, reproducible and detailed experimental survey of OM measures and WE models reported in the literature which is based on the evaluation of both families of methods on a same software platform, with the aim of elucidating what is the state of the problem. We show that WE models which combine distributional and ontology-based information get the best results, and in addition, we show for the first time that a simple average of two best performing WE models with other ontology-based measures or WE models is able to improve the state of the art by a large margin. In addition, we provide a very detailed reproducibility protocol together with a collection of software tools and datasets as supplementary material to allow the exact replication of our results.

    The suggestions proposed by Lee et al. to improve cognitive modeling practices have significant parallels to the current best practices for improving reproducibility in the field of Machine Learning. In the current commentary on `Robust modeling in cognitive science', we highlight the practices that overlap and discuss how similar proposals have produced novel ongoing challenges, including cultural change towards open science, the scalability and interpretability of required practices, and the downstream effects of having robust practices that are fully transparent. Through this, we hope to inform future practices in computational modeling work with a broader scope.

         Current concerns about reproducibility in many research communities can be traced back to a high value placed on empirical reproducibility of the physical details of scientific experiments and observations. For example, the detailed descriptions by 17th century scientist Robert Boyle of his vacuum pump experiments are often held to be the ideal of reproducibility as a cornerstone of scientific practice. Victoria Stodden has claimed that the computer is an analog for Boyle's pump -- another kind of scientific instrument that needs detailed descriptions of how it generates results. In the place of Boyle's hand-written notes, we now expect code in open source programming languages to be available to enable others to reproduce and extend computational experiments. In this paper we show that there is another genealogy for reproducibility, starting at least from Euclid, in the production of proofs in mathematics. Proofs have a distinctive quality of being necessarily reproducible, and are the cornerstone of mathematical science. However, the task of the modern mathematical scientist has drifted from that of blackboard rhetorician, where the craft of proof reigned, to a scientific workflow that now more closely resembles that of an experimental scientist. So, what is proof in modern mathematics? And, if proof is unattainable in other fields, what is due scientific diligence in a computational experimental environment? How do we measure truth in the context of uncertainty? Adopting a manner of Lakatosian conversant conjecture between two mathematicians, we examine how proof informs our practice of computational statistical inquiry. We propose that a reorientation of mathematical science is necessary so that its reproducibility can be readily assessed.

    Literature reviews play a key role in information systems (IS) research by describing, understanding, testing, and explaining the constructs and theories within a particular topic area. In recent years, various commentaries, debates, and editorials in the field’s top journals have highlighted the importance of systematicity and transparency in creating trustworthy literature reviews. Although also recognized as being important, the characteristic of reproducibility of IS literature reviews has not received nearly the same level of attention. This paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the elements required for high quality IS literature reviews by clarifying the role of reproducibility. In doing so, we find that the concept of reproducibility has been misunderstood in much of the guidance to authors of IS literature reviews. Based on this observation, we make several suggestions for clarifying the terminology and identifying when reproducibility is desirable and feasible within IS literature reviews.

         In this paper, we describe DiOS, a lightweight model operating system which can be used to execute programs that make use of POSIX APIs. Such executions are fully reproducible: running the same program with the same inputs twice will result in two exactly identical instruction traces, even if the program uses threads for parallelism. DiOS is implemented almost entirely in portable C and C++: although its primary platform is DiVM, a verification-oriented virtua machine, it can be configured to also run in KLEE, a symbolic executor. Finally, it can be compiled into machine code to serve as a user-mode kernel. Additionally, DiOS is modular and extensible. Its various components can be combined to match both the capabilities of the underlying platform and to provide services required by a particular program. New components can be added to cover additional system calls or APIs. The experimental evaluation has two parts. DiOS is first evaluated as a component of a program verification platform based on DiVM. In the second part, we consider its portability and modularity by combining it with the symbolic executor KLEE.

    Can topic models be used in research evaluations? Reproducibility, validity, and reliability when compared with semantic maps

     We replicate and analyze the topic model which was commissioned to King’s College and Digital Science for the Research Evaluation Framework (REF 2014) in the United Kingdom: 6,638 case descriptions of societal impact were submitted by 154 higher-education institutes. We compare the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of document-term matrices using the same data. Since topic models are almost by definition applied to text corpora which are too large to read, validation of the results of these models is hardly possible; furthermore the models are irreproducible for a number of reasons. However, removing a small fraction of the documents from the sample—a test for reliability—has on average a larger impact in terms of decay on LDA than on PCA-based models. The semantic coherence of LDA models outperforms PCA-based models. In our opinion, results of the topic models are statistical and should not be used for grant selections and micro decision-making about research without follow-up using domain-specific semantic maps.

     The pressures of a scientific career can end up incentivising an all‐or‐nothing approach to cross the finish line first. While competition can be healthy and drives innovation, the current system fails to encourage scientists to work reproducibility. This sometimes leaves those individuals who come second to correct mistakes in published research without being rewarded. Instead, we need a culture that rewards reproducibility and holds it as important as the novelty of the result. Here, I draw on my own journey in the oestrogen receptor research field to highlight this and suggest ways for the 'first past the post' culture to be challenged.

     Although many works in the database community use open data in their experimental evaluation, repeating the empirical results of previous works remains a challenge. This holds true even if the source code or binaries of the tested algorithms are available. In this paper, we argue that providing access to the raw, original datasets is not enough. Real-world datasets are rarely processed without modification. Instead, the data is adapted to the needs of the experimental evaluation in the data preparation process. We showcase that the details of the data preparation process matter and subtle differences during data conversion can have a large impact on the outcome of runtime results. We introduce a data reproducibility model, identify three levels of data reproducibility, report about our own experience, and exemplify our best practices.

     Reproducibility plays a crucial role in experimentation. However, the modern research ecosystem and the underlying frameworks are constantly evolving and thereby making it extremely difficult to reliably reproduce scientific artifacts such as  data, algorithms, trained models and visual-izations. We therefore aim to design a novel system for assisting data scientists with rigorous end-to-end documentation of data-oriented experiments. Capturing data lineage, metadata, andother artifacts helps  reproducing and sharing experimental results. We summarize this challenge as automated documentation of  data science experiments. We aim at reducing manualoverhead for experimenting researchers, and intend to create a novel approach in dataflow and metadata tracking based on the analysis of the experiment source code. The envisioned system will accelerate the research process in general, andenable capturing fine-grained meta information by deriving a declarative representation of data science experiments.

     Lee et al. (2019) make several practical recommendations for replicable, useful cognitive modeling. They also point out that the ultimate test of the usefulness of a cognitive model is its ability to solve practical problems. In this commentary, we argue that for cognitive modeling to reach applied domains, there is a pressing need to improve the standards of transparency and reproducibility in cognitive modelling research. Solution-oriented modeling requires engaging practitioners who understand the relevant domain. We discuss mechanisms by which reproducible research can foster engagement with applied practitioners. Notably, reproducible materials provide a start point for practitioners to experiment with cognitive models and determine whether those models might be suitable for their domain of expertise.  This is essential because solving complex problems requires exploring a range of modeling approaches, and there may not time to implement each possible approach from the ground up. We also note the broader benefits to reproducibility within the field.

     Preparation of data sets for analysis is a critical component of research in many disciplines. Recording the steps taken to clean data sets is equally crucial if such research is to be transparent and results reproducible. OpenRefine is a tool for interactively cleaning data sets via a spreadsheet-like interface and for recording the sequence of operations carried out by the user. OpenRefine uses its operation history to provide an undo/redo capability that enables a user to revisit the state of the data set at any point in the data cleaning process. OpenRefine additionally allows the user to export sequences of recorded operations as recipes that can be applied later to different data sets. Although OpenRefine internally records details about every change made to a data set following data import, exported recipes do not include the initial data import step. Details related to parsing the original data files are not included. Moreover, exported recipes do not include any edits made manually to individual cells. Consequently, neither a single recipe, nor a set of recipes exported by OpenRefine, can in general represent an entire, end-to-end data preparation workflow. Here we report early results from an investigation into how the operation history recorded by OpenRefine can be used to (1) facilitate reproduction of complete, real-world data cleaning workflows; and (2) support queries and visualizations of the provenance of cleaned data sets for easy review.

      The Target Article by Lee et al. (2019) highlights the ways in which ongoing concerns about research reproducibility extend to model-based approaches in cognitive science. Whereas Lee et al. focus primarily on the importance of research practices to improve model robustness, we propose that the transparent sharing of model specifications, including their inputs and outputs, is also essential to improving the reproducibility of model-based analyses. We outline an ongoing effort (within the context of the Brain Imaging Data Structure community) to develop standards for the sharing of the structure of computational models and their outputs.

      Computational Communication Research (CCR) is a new open access journal dedicated to publishing high quality computational research in communication science. This editorial introduction describes the role that we envision for the journal.  First, we explain what computational communication science is and why a new journal is needed for this subfield.  Then, we elaborate on the type of research this journal seeks to publish, and stress the need for transparent and reproducible science.  The relation between theoretical development and computational analysis is discussed, and we argue for the value of null-findings and risky research in additive science. Subsequently, the (experimental) two-phase review process is described. In this process,  after the first double-blind review phase, an editor can signal that they intend to publish the article conditional on satisfactory revisions. This starts the second review phase, in which authors and reviewers are no longer required to be anonymous and the authors are encouraged to publish a preprint to their article which will be linked as working paper from the journal. Finally, we introduce the four articles that, together with this Introduction, form the inaugural issue.

      The main criticism of my piece in ref (2) seems to be that my calculations rely on testing a point null hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis that the true effect size is zero. He objects to my contention that the true effect size can be zero, "just give the same pill to both groups", on the grounds that two pills can't be exactly identical. He then says "I understand that this criticism may come across as frivolous semantic pedantry of no practical consequence: of course that the author meant to say 'pills with the same contents' as everybody would have understood". Yes, that is precisely how it comes across to me. I shall try to explain in more detail why I think that this criticism has little substance.

description: |
      Ongoing technological developments have made it easier than ever before for scientists to share their data, materials, and analysis code. Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to re-use or check published research. These benefits will only emerge if researchers can reproduce the analysis reported in published articles, and if data is annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variables mean. Because most researchers have not been trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify practices that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing, as well as computational reproducibility of the main results without contacting the original authors, for Registered Reports published in the in psychological literature between 2014 and 2018. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria data was available for 40 articles, and analysis scripts for 43 articles. For the 35 articles that shared both data and code and performed analyses in SPSS, R, or JASP, we could run the scripts for 30 articles, and reproduce the main results for 19 articles. Although the percentage of articles that shared both data and code (61%) and articles that could be computationally reproduced (54%) was relatively high compared to other studies, there is clear room for improvement. We provide practices recommendations based on our observations, and link to examples of good research practices in the papers we reproduced.

The  scientist  has  to  take  care  about  provenance  of  thewhole  data  processing  pipeline.  This  is  not  a  trivial  task  dueto the diverse set of computational tools and environments usedduring the transformation of raw data to the final results.

      Methodological Reporting Behavior, Sample Sizes, and Statistical Power in Studies of Event- Related Potentials: Barriers to Reproducibility and Replicability

description: |
      Methodological reporting guidelines for studies of event-related potentials (ERPs) were updated in Psychophysiology in 2014. These guidelines facilitate the communication of key methodological parameters (e.g., preprocessing steps). Failing to report key parameters represents a barrier to replication efforts, and difficultly with replicability increases in the presence of small sample sizes and low statistical power. We assessed whether guidelines are followed and estimated the average sample size and power in recent research. Reporting behavior, sample sizes, and statistical designs were coded for 150 randomly-sampled articles from five high-impact journals that frequently publish ERP studies from 2011 to 2017. An average of 63% of guidelines were reported, and reporting behavior was similar across journals, suggesting that gaps in reporting is a shortcoming of the field rather than any specific journal. Publication of the guidelines paper had no impact on reporting behavior, suggesting that editors and peer reviewers are not enforcing these recommendations. The average sample size per group was 21. Statistical power was conservatively estimated as .72-.98 for a large effect size, .35-.73 for a medium effect, and .10-.18 for a small effect. These findings indicate that failing to report key guidelines is ubiquitous and that ERP studies are only powered to detect large effects. Such low power and insufficient following of reporting guidelines represent substantial barriers to replication efforts. The methodological transparency and replicability of studies can be improved by the open sharing of processing code and experimental tasks and by a priori sample size calculations to ensure adequately powered studies.

      Linking interindividual differences in psychological phenotype to variations in brain structure is an old dream for psychology and a crucial question for cognitive neurosciences. Yet, replicability of the previously-reported ‘structural brain behavior’ (SBB)-associations has been questioned, recently. Here, we conducted an empirical investigation, assessing replicability of SBB among heathy adults. For a wide range of psychological measures, the replicability of associations with gray matter volume was assessed. Our results revealed that among healthy individuals 1) finding an association between performance at standard psychological tests and brain morphology is relatively unlikely 2) significant associations, found using an exploratory approach, have overestimated effect sizes and 3) can hardly be replicated in an independent sample. After considering factors such as sample size and comparing our findings with more replicable SBB-associations in a clinical cohort and replicable associations between brain structure and non-psychological phenotype, we discuss the potential causes and consequences of these findings.

      Transparency in reporting benefits scientific communication on many levels. While specific needs and expectations vary across fields, the effective use of research findings relies on the availability of core information about research materials, data, and analysis. In December 2017, a working group of journal editors and experts in reproducibility convened to create the “minimum standards” working group. This working group aims to devise a set of minimum expectations that journals could ask their authors to meet, and will draw from the collective experience of journals implementing a range of different approaches designed to enhance reporting and reproducibility (e.g. STAR Methods), existing life science checklists (e.g. the Nature Research reporting summary), and the results of recent meta-research studying the efficacy of such interventions (e.g. Macleod et al. 2017; Han et al. 2017).

      In 2004, a landmark study showed that an inexpensive medication to treat parasitic worms could improve health and school attendance for millions of children in many developing countries. Eleven years later, a headline in the Guardian reported that this treatment, deworming, had been "debunked."The pronouncement followed an effort to replicate and re-analyze the original study, as well as an update to a systematic review of the effects of deworming. This story made waves amidst discussion of a reproducibility crisis in some of the social sciences. This paper explores what it means to"replicate"and"reanalyze"a study, both in general and in the specific case of deworming. The paper reviews the broader replication efforts in economics, then examines the key findings of the original deworming paper in light of the "replication," "reanalysis," and "systematic review."The paper also discusses the nature of the link between this single paper's findings, other papers' findings, and any policy recommendations about deworming. This example provides a perspective on the ways replication and reanalysis work, the strengths and weaknesses of systematic reviews, and whether there is, in fact, a reproducibility crisis in economics.

      Serious concerns about research quality have catalyzed a number of reform initiatives intended to improve transparency and reproducibility and thus facilitate self-correction, increase efficiency, and enhance research credibility. Meta-research has evaluated the merits of individual initiatives; however, this may not capture broader trends reflecting the cumulative contribution of these efforts. In this study, we evaluated a broad range of indicators related to transparency and reproducibility in a random sample of 198 articles published in the social sciences between 2014 and 2017. Few articles indicated availability of materials (15/96, 16% [95% confidence interval, 9% to 23%]), protocols (0/103), raw data (8/103, 8% [2% to 15%]), or analysis scripts (3/103, 3% [1% to 6%]), and no studies were pre-registered (0/103). Some articles explicitly disclosed funding sources (or lack of; 72/179, 40% [33% to 48%]) and some declared no conflicts of interest (32/179, 18% [13% to 24%]). Replication studies were rare (2/103, 2% [0% to 4%]). Few studies were included in evidence synthesis via systematic review (6/96, 6% [3% to 11%]) or meta-analysis (2/96, 2% [0% to 4%]). Slightly less than half the articles were publicly available (95/198, 48% [41% to 55%]). Minimal adoption of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices could be undermining the credibility and efficiency of social science research. The present study establishes a baseline that can be revisited in the future to assess progress.

     Science progresses through critical evaluation of underlying evidence and independent replication of results. However, most research findings are disseminated without access to supporting raw data, and findings are not routinely replicated. Furthermore, undisclosed flexibility in data analysis, such as incomplete reporting, unclear exclusion criteria, and optional stopping rules allow for presenting exploratory research findings using the tools of confirmatory hypothesis testing. These questionable research practices make results more publishable, though it comes at the expense of their credibility and future replicability. The Center for Open Science builds tools and encourages practices that incentivizes work that is not only good for the scientist, but also good for science. These include open source platforms to organize research, archive results, preregister analyses, and disseminate findings. This poster presents an overview of those practices and gives practical advice for researchers who want to increase the rigor of their practices.

     Over the coming years, a core objective of the BNA is to promote and support credibility in neuroscience, facilitating a cultural shift away from ‘publish or perish’ towards one which is best for neuroscience, neuroscientists, policymakers and the public. Among many of our credibility activities, we will lead by example by ensuring that our journal, Brain and Neuroscience Advances, exemplifies scientific practices that aim to improve the reproducibility, replicability and reliability of neuroscience research. To support these practices, we are implementing some of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines, including badges for open data, open materials and preregistered studies. The journal also offers the Registered Report (RR) article format. In this editorial, we describe our expectations for articles submitted to Brain and Neuroscience Advances.

     By implementing more transparent research practices, authors have the opportunity to stand out and showcase work that is more reproducible, easier to build upon, and more credible. Scientists gain by making work easier to share and maintain within their own laboratories, and the scientific community gains by making underlying data or research materials more available for confirmation or making new discoveries. The following protocol gives authors step‐by‐step instructions for using the free and open source Open Science Framework (OSF) to create a data management plan, preregister their study, use version control, share data and other research materials, or post a preprint for quick and easy dissemination.

     Lack of reproducibility in biomedical science is aserious and growing issue. Two publications, in 2011 and 2012, along with other analyses, documented failures to replicate key findings and other fundamental flaws in high-visibility research articles. This triggered action among funding bodies, journals, and other change-agents. Here, I examine well-recognized and underrecognized factors that contribute to experimental failure andsuggest individual and community approaches that can be used to attack these factors and eschew the SPECTRE of irreproducibility.

For several reasons, including the sensitive and/or proprietarynature of some Internet measurements, the networking research community pays limited attentionto the of reproducibility of results, instead tending to accept papers that appear plausible.This article summarises a 2.5 day long Dagstuhl seminar on Encouraging Reproducibility inScientific Research of the Internet held in October 2018. The seminar discussed challenges toimproving reproducibility of scientific Internet research, and developed a set of recommendationsthat we as a community can undertake to initiate a cultural change toward reproducibility ofour work. It brought together people both from academia and industry to set expectations andformulate concrete recommendations for reproducible research. This iteration of the seminar wasscoped to computer networking research, although the outcomes are likely relevant for a broaderaudience from multiple interdisciplinary fields.

Across seven Discussion Forum pieces, scientists representing a range of backgrounds and career levels reflect on whether the "reproducibility crisis" – or "credibility revolution" (Vazire, 2018; Munafò et al., 2017) – that has achieved such prominence in psychology has extended into cognitive neuroscience. If so, they ask, what is the underlying cause and how can we solve it?

description: |
     Reproducibility is fundamental to science, and an important component of reproducibility is computational reproducibility: the ability of a researcher to recreate the results in a published paper using the original author's raw data and code. Although most people agree that computational reproducibility is important, it is still difficult to achieve in practice. In this paper, we describe our approach to enabling computational reproducibility for the 12 papers in this special issue of Socius about the Fragile Families Challenge. Our approach draws on two tools commonly used by professional software engineers but not widely used by academic researchers: software containers (e.g., Docker) and cloud computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services). These tools enabled us to standardize the computing environment around each submission, which will ease computational reproducibility both today and in the future. Drawing on our successes and struggles, we conclude with recommendations to authors and journals.

     Web technology has transformed our lives, and has led to a paradigm shift in the computational sciences. As the neuroimaging informatics research community amasses large datasets to answer complex neuroscience questions, we find that the web is the best medium to facilitate novel insights by way of improved collaboration and communication. Here, we review the landscape of web technologies used in neuroimaging research, and discuss future applications, areas for improvement, and the limitations of using web technology in research. Fully incorporating web technology in our research lifecycle requires not only technical skill, but a widespread culture change; a shift from the small, focused "wet lab" to a multidisciplinary and largely collaborative "web lab."

description: |
          Reproducibility should be a cornerstone of scientific research and is a growing concern among the scientific community and the public. Understanding how to design services and tools that support documentation, preservation and sharing is required to maximize the positive impact of scientific research. We conducted a study of user attitudes towards systems that support data preservation in High Energy Physics, one of science's most data-intensive branches. We report on our interview study with 12 experimental physicists, studying requirements and opportunities in designing for research preservation and reproducibility. Our findings suggest that we need to design for motivation and benefits in order to stimulate contributions and to address the observed scalability challenge. Therefore, researchers' attitudes towards communication, uncertainty, collaboration and automation need to be reflected in design. Based on our findings, we present a systematic view of user needs and constraints that define the design space of systems supporting reproducible practices.

     Multi-scale computational modeling is a major branch of computational biology as evidenced by the US federal interagency Multi-Scale Modeling Consortium and major international projects. It invariably involves specific and detailed sequences of data analysis and simulation, often with multiple tools and datasets, and the community recognizes improved modularity, reuse, reproducibility, portability and scalability as critical unmet needs in this area. Scientific workflows are a well-recognized strategy for addressing these needs in scientific computing. While there are good examples if the use of scientific workflows in bioinformatics, medical informatics, biomedical imaging and data analysis, there are fewer examples in multi-scale computational modeling in general and cardiac electrophysiology in particular. Cardiac electrophysiology simulation is a mature area of multi-scale computational biology that serves as an excellent use case for developing and testing new scientific workflows. In this article, we develop, describe and test a computational workflow that serves as a proof of concept of a platform for the robust integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible multi-scale cardiac cell and tissue model that is expandable, modular and portable. The workflow described leverages Python and Kepler-Python actor for plotting and pre/post-processing. During all stages of the workflow design, we rely on freely available open-source tools, to make our workflow freely usable by scientists.

     Scripts and Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) are common approachesthat have been used to automate the execution flow of processes and data analysis in scien-tific (computational) experiments. Although widely used in many disciplines, scripts arehard to understand, adapt, reuse, and reproduce. For this reason, several solutions havebeen proposed to aid experiment reproducibility for script-based environments. However,they neither allow to fully document the experiment nor do they help when third partieswant to reuse just part of the code. SWfMSs, on the other hand, help documentationand reuse by supporting scientists in the design and execution of their experiments, whichare specified and run as interconnected (reusable) workflow components (a.k.a. buildingblocks). While workflows are better than scripts for understandability and reuse, they stillrequire additional documentation. During experiment design, scientists frequently createworkflow variants, e.g., by changing workflow components.  Reuse and reproducibilityrequire understanding and tracking variant provenance, a time-consuming task. This the-sis aims to support reproducibility and reuse of computational experiments.  To meetthese challenges, we address two research problems: (1) understanding a computationalexperiment, and (2) extending a computational experiment. Our work towards solvingthese problems led us to choose workflows and ontologies to answer both problems. Themain contributions of this thesis are thus: (i) to present the requirements for the con-version of script to reproducible research; (ii) to propose a methodology that guides thescientists through the process of conversion of script-based experiments into reproducibleworkflow research objects; (iii) to design and implement features for quality assessmentof computational experiments; (iv) to design and implement W2Share, a framework tosupport the conversion methodology, which exploits tools and standards that have beendeveloped by the scientific community to promote reuse and reproducibility; (v) to designand implement OntoSoft-VFF, a framework for capturing information about software andworkflow components to support scientists manage workflow exploration and evolution.Our work is showcased via use cases in Molecular Dynamics, Bioinformatics and WeatherForecasting

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
     There is broad interest to improve the reproducibility of published research. We developed a survey tool to assess the availability of digital research artifacts published alongside peer-reviewed journal articles (e.g. data, models, code, directions for use) and reproducibility of article results. We used the tool to assess 360 of the 1,989 articles published by six hydrology and water resources journals in 2017. Like studies from other fields, we reproduced results for only a small fraction of articles (1.6% of tested articles) using their available artifacts. We estimated, with 95% confidence, that results might be reproduced for only 0.6% to 6.8% of all 1,989 articles. Unlike prior studies, the survey tool identified key bottlenecks to making work more reproducible. Bottlenecks include: only some digital artifacts available (44% of articles), no directions (89%), or all artifacts available but results not reproducible (5%). The tool (or extensions) can help authors, journals, funders, and institutions to self-assess manuscripts, provide feedback to improve reproducibility, and recognize and reward reproducible articles as examples for others.

     The computational reproducibility of analytic results has been discussed and evaluated in many different scientific disciplines, all of which have one finding in common: analytic results are far too often not reproducible.  There are numerous examples of reproducibility guidelines for various applications, however, a comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating the individual components of the research pipeline was unavailable.  To address this need, COS developed the ReproRubric, which defines multiple Tiers of reproducibility based on criteria established for each critical stage of the typical research workflow - from initial design of the experiment through final reporting of the results.

     The contemporary scientific community places a growing emphasis on the reproducibility of research. The projects R package is a free, open-source endeavor created in the interest of facilitating reproducible research workflows. It adds to existing software tools for reproducible research and introduces several practical features that are helpful for scientists and their collaborative research teams. For each individual project, it supplies an intuitive framework for storing raw and cleaned study data sets, and provides script templates for protocol creation, data cleaning, data analysis and manuscript development. Internal databases of project and author information are generated and displayed, and manuscript title pages containing author lists and their affiliations are automatically generated from the internal database. File management tools allow teams to organize multiple projects. When used on a shared file system, multiple researchers can harmoniously contribute to the same project in a less punctuated manner, reducing the frequency of misunderstandings and the need for status updates.

     Most efforts to estimate the reproducibility of published findings have focused on specific areas of research, even though science is usually assessed and funded on a regional or national basis. Here we describe a project to assess the reproducibility of findings in biomedical science published by researchers based in Brazil. The Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative is a systematic, multi-center effort to repeatbetween 60 and 100 experiments: theproject will focus on a set of common laboratory methods, repeating each experiment in three different laboratories. The results, due in 2021, will allow us to estimate the level of reproducibility of biomedical sciencein Brazil, and to investigate what the published literature can tell us about the reproducibility ofresearch in a given area.

     As databases of medical information are growing, the cost of analyzing data is falling, and computer scientists, engineers, and investment are flooding into the field, digital medicine is subject to increasingly hyperbolic claims. Every week brings news of advances: superior algorithms that can predict clinical events and disease trajectory, classify images better than humans, translate clinical texts, and generate sensational discoveries around new risk factors and treatment effects. Yet the excitement about digital medicine—along with the technologies like the ones that enable a million people to watch a major event—poses risks for its robustness. How many of those new findings, in other words, are likely to be reproducible?

A further 68 (42%) were at least partially successful.  A total of 98 out of 303 (32.3%) relied on confidential or proprietary data, and were thus not reproducible by this project.  We also conduct several bibliometric analyses of reproducible vs. non-reproducible articles.

     Docker seems to be an attractive solution for cloud database benchmarking as it simplifies the setup process through pre-built images that are portable and simple to maintain. However, the usage of Docker for benchmarking is only valid if there is no effect on measurement results. Existing work has so far only focused on the performance overheads that Docker directly induces for specific applications. In this paper, we have studied indirect effects of dockerization on the results of database benchmarking. Among others, our results clearly show that containerization has a measurable and non-constant influence on measurement results and should, hence, only be used after careful analysis.

     A Reaction Norm Perspective on Reproducibility

description: |
     Reproducibility in biomedical research,  and more specifically in preclinical animal research, has been seriously questioned.  Several cases of spectacular failures to replicate findings published in the primary scientific literature have led to a perceived reproducibility crisis.  Diverse threats to reproducibility have been proposed, including lack of scientific rigour, low  statistical  power,  publication  bias,  analytical  flexibility  and  fraud. An important aspect that is generally overlooked is the lack of external validity caused by rigorous standardization of both the animals and the environment.  Here,  we argue that a reaction norm approach to pheno- typic variation, acknowledging gene-by-environment interactions, can help us seeing reproducibility of animal experiments in a new light.  We illustrate how dominating environmental effects can affect inference and effect size estimates of studies and how elimination of dominant factors through standardization  affects  the  nature  of  the  expected  phenotype  variation. We do this by introducing a construct that we dubbed the reaction norm of small effects.  Finally, we discuss the consequences of a reaction norm of small effects for statistical analysis, specifically for random effect latent variable models and the random lab model.

     Open Science is key to future scientific research and promotes a deep transformation in the whole scientific research process encouraging the adoption of transparent and collaborative scientific approaches aimed at knowledge sharing. Open Science is increasingly gaining attention in the current and future research agenda worldwide. To effectively address Open Science goals, besides Open Access to results and data, it is also paramount to provide tools or environments to support the whole research process, in particular the design, execution and sharing of transparent and reproducible experiments, including data provenance (or lineage) tracking. This work introduces the Climate Analytics-Hub, a new component on top of the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), which joins big data approaches and parallel computing paradigms to provide an Open Science environment for reproducible multi-model climate change data analytics experiments at scale. An operational implementation has been set up at the SuperComputing Centre of the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, with the main goal of becoming a reference Open Science hub in the climate community regarding the multi-model analysis based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).

     Whenever   high-performance   computing   applications meet data-intensive scalable systems, an attractive approach is  the  use  of  Apache  Spark  for  the  management  of  scientific workflows.  Spark  provides  several  advantages  such  as  being widely  supported  and  granting  efficient  in-memory  data  management  for  large-scale  applications.  However,  Spark  still  lacks support for data tracking and workflow provenance. Additionally, Spark’s  memory  management  requires  accessing  all  data  movements  between  the  workflow  activities.  Therefore,  the  running of  legacy  programs  on  Spark  is  interpreted  as  a  "black-box" activity, which prevents the capture and analysis of implicit data movements. Here, we present SAMbA, an Apache Spark extension for  the  gathering  of  prospective  and  retrospective  provenance and  domain  data  within  distributed  scientific  workflows.  Our approach  relies  on  enveloping  both  RDD  structure  and  data contents  at  runtime  so  that (i) RDD-enclosure  consumed  and produced   data   are   captured   and   registered   by SAMbA in   a structured way, and (ii) provenance data can be queried during and  after  the  execution  of  scientific  workflows.  By  following the  W3C  PROV  representation,  we  model  the  roles  of  RDD regarding  prospective  and  retrospective  provenance  data.  Our solution  provides  mechanisms  for  the  capture  and  storage  of provenance data without jeopardizing Spark’s performance. The provenance  retrieval  capabilities  of  our  proposal  are  evaluated in  a  practical  case  study,  in  which  data  analytics  are  provided by  several SAMbA parameterizations.

     There has been a recent major upsurge in the concerns about reproducibility in many areas of science. Within the neuroimaging domain, one approach is to promote reproducibility is to target the re-executability of the publication. The information supporting such re-executability can enable the detailed examination of how an initial finding generalizes across changes in the processing approach, and sampled population, in a controlled scientific fashion. ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation is a recently funded initiative that seeks to facilitate the ‘last mile’ implementations of core re-executability tools in order to reduce the accessibility barrier and increase adoption of standards and best practices at the neuroimaging research laboratory level. In this report, we summarize the overall approach and tools we have developed in this domain.

     WINGS enables researchers to submit complete semantic  workflows  as  challenge  submissions.    By  submitting  entries  as  workflows,  it  then becomes possible to compare not just the results and performance of a challenger, but also the methodology employed.  This is particularly important when dozens of challenge entries may use nearly  identical  tools,  but  with  only  subtle  changes  in  parameters  (and  radical  differences  in results). WINGS uses a component driven workflow design and offers intelligent parameter and data selectionby reasoning  aboutdata  characteristics.

     Increasingly complex statistical models are being used for the analysis of biological data. Recent commentary has focused on the ability to compute the same outcome for a given dataset (reproducibility). We argue that a reproducible statistical analysis is not necessarily valid because of unique patterns of nonindependence in every biological dataset. We advocate that analyses should be evaluated with known-truth simulations that capture biological reality, a process we call “analysis validation.” We review the process of validation and suggest criteria that a validation project should meet. We find that different fields of science have historically failed to meet all criteria, and we suggest ways to implement meaningful validation in training and practice.

     Mechanobiology, the study of how mechanical forces affect cellular behavior, is an emerging field of study that has garnered broad and significant interest. Researchers are currently seeking to better understand how mechanical signals are transmitted, detected, and integrated at a subcellular level. One tool for addressing these questions is a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)‐based tension sensor, which enables the measurement of molecular‐scale forces across proteins based on changes in emitted light. However, the reliability and reproducibility of measurements made with these sensors has not been thoroughly examined. To address these concerns, we developed numerical methods that improve the accuracy of measurements made using sensitized emission‐based imaging. To establish that FRET‐based tension sensors are versatile tools that provide consistent measurements, we used these methods, and demonstrated that a vinculin tension sensor is unperturbed by cell fixation, permeabilization, and immunolabeling. This suggests FRET‐based tension sensors could be coupled with a variety of immuno‐fluorescent labeling techniques. Additionally, as tension sensors are frequently employed in complex biological samples where large experimental repeats may be challenging, we examined how sample size affects the uncertainty of FRET measurements. In total, this work establishes guidelines to improve FRET‐based tension sensor measurements, validate novel implementations of these sensors, and ensure that results are precise and reproducible.

     We — a surgeon, a research nurse and a synthetic chemist — looked beyond science to discover how people steeped in artistic skills might help to close this 'haptic gap', the deficit in skills of touch and object manipulation. We have found that craftspeople and performers can work fruitfully alongside scientists to address some of the challenges. We have also discovered striking similarities between the observational skills of an entomologist and an analytical chemist; the dexterity of a jeweller and a microsurgeon; the bodily awareness of a dancer and a space scientist; and the creative skills of a scientific glassblower, a reconstructive surgeon, a potter and a chef.

      Trusting simulation output is crucial for Sandia's mission objectives. We rely on these simulations to perform our high-consequence mission tasks given national treaty obligations. Other science and modeling applications, while they may have high-consequence results, still require the strongest levels of trust to enable using the result as the foundation for both practical applications and future research. To this end, the computing community has developed workflow and provenance systems to aid in both automating simulation and modeling execution as well as determining exactly how was some output was created so that conclusions can be drawn from the data. Current approaches for workflows and provenance systems are all at the user level and have little to no system level support making them fragile, difficult to use, and incomplete solutions. The introduction of container technology is a first step towards encapsulating and tracking artifacts used in creating data and resulting insights, but their current implementation is focused solely on making it easy to deploy an application in an isolated "sandbox" and maintaining a strictly read-only mode to avoid any potential changes to the application. All storage activities are still using the system-level shared storage. This project explores extending the container concept to include storage as a new container type we call \emph{data pallets}. Data Pallets are potentially writeable, auto generated by the system based on IO activities, and usable as a way to link the contained data back to the application and input deck used to create it.

  The literature on the reproducibility crisis presents several putative causes for the proliferation of irreproducible results, including HARKing, p-hacking and publication bias. Without a theory of reproducibility, however, it is difficult to determine whether these putative causes can explain most irreproducible results. Drawing from an historically informed conception of science that is open and collaborative, we identify the components of an idealized experiment and analyze these components as a precursor to develop such a theory. Openness, we suggest, has long been intuitively proposed as a solution to irreproducibility. However, this intuition has not been validated in a theoretical framework. Our concern is that the under-theorizing of these concepts can lead to flawed inferences about the (in)validity of experimental results or integrity of individual scientists. We use probabilistic arguments and examine how openness of experimental components relates to reproducibility of results. We show that there are some impediments to obtaining reproducible results that precede many of the causes often cited in literature on the reproducibility crisis. For example, even if erroneous practices such as HARKing, p-hacking, and publication bias were absent at the individual and system level, reproducibility may still not be guaranteed.

      Although essential to the development of a robust evidence base for nurse educators, the concepts of replication and reproducibility have received little attention in the nursing education literature. In this Methodology Corner installment, the concepts of study replication and reproducibility are explored in depth. In designing, conducting, and documenting the findings of studies in nursing education, researchers are encouraged to make design choices that improve study replicability and reproducibility of study findings. [J Nurs Educ. 2018;57(11):638–640.] There has been considerable discussion in the professional literature about questionable research practices that raise doubt about the credibility of research findings (Shrout & Rodgers, 2018) and that limit reproducibility of research findings (Shepherd, Peratikos, Rebeiro, Duda, & McCowan, 2017). This discussion has led to what scientists term as a replication crisis (Goodman, Fanelli, & Ioannidis, 2016). Although investigators in various disciplines have provided suggestions to address this crisis (Alvarez, Key, & Núñez, 2018; Goodman et al., 2016; Shrout & Rodgers, 2018), similar discussions or reports of replication within nursing education literature are limited, despite a call for replication studies (Morin, 2016). Consequently, the focus of this article is on replication and reproducibility. The topic is important, given that the hallmark of good science is being able to replicate or reproduce findings (Morin, 2016). Replication serves to provide “stability in our knowledge of nature” (Schmidt, 2009, p. 92).

        Cell culture is a vital component of laboratories throughout the scientifi c community, yet the absence of standardized protocols and documentation practice challenges laboratory effi ciency and scientific reproducibility. We examined the effectiveness of a cloud-based software application, CultureTrax ®  as a tool for standardizing and transferring a complex cell culture protocol. The software workfl ow and template were used to electronically format a cardiomyocyte differentiation protocol and share a digitally executable copy with a different lab user. While the protocol was unfamiliar to the recipient, they executed the experiment by solely using CultureTrax and successfully derived cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells. This software tool significantly reduced the time and resources required to effectively transfer and implement a  novel protocol.

      Replicability or reproducibility? On the replication crisis in computational neuroscience and sharing only relevant detail

      Replicability and reproducibility of computational models has been somewhat understudied by “the replication movement.” In this paper, we draw on methodological studies into the replicability of psychological experiments and on the mechanistic account of explanation to analyze the functions of model replications and model reproductions in computational neuroscience. We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution. Reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.

      Web document collections such as WT10G, GOV2, and ClueWeb are widely used for text retrieval experiments. Documents in these collections contain a fair amount of non-content-related markup in the form of tags, hyperlinks, and so on. Published articles that use these corpora generally do not provide specific details about how this markup information is handled during indexing. However, this question turns out to be important: Through experiments, we find that including or excluding metadata in the index can produce significantly different results with standard IR models. More importantly, the effect varies across models and collections. For example, metadata filtering is found to be generally beneficial when using BM25, or language modeling with Dirichlet smoothing, but can significantly reduce retrieval effectiveness if language modeling is used with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing. We also observe that, in general, the performance differences become more noticeable as the amount of metadata in the test collections increase. Given this variability, we believe that the details of document preprocessing are significant from the point of view of reproducibility. In a second set of experiments, we also study the effect of preprocessing on query expansion using RM3. In this case, once again, we find that it is generally better to remove markup before using documents for query expansion.

       In recent years, biomedical research has faced increased scrutiny over issues related to reproducibility and quality in scientific findings(1-3). In response to this scrutiny, funding institutions and journals have implemented top-down policies for grant and manuscript review. While a positive step forward, the long-term merit of these policies is questionable given their emphasis on completing a check-list of items instead of a fundamental re-assessment of how scientific investigation is conducted. Moreover, the top-down style of management used to institute these policies can be argued as being ineffective in engaging the scientific workforce to act upon these issues. To meet current and future biomedical needs, new investigative methods that emphasize collective-thinking, teamwork, shared knowledge and cultivate change from the bottom-up are warranted. Here, a perspective on a new approach to biomedical investigation within the individual laboratory that emphasizes collaboration and quality is discussed.

      A challenge in modern research is the common inability to repeat novel findings published in even the most “impact-heavy” journals. In the great majority of instances, this may simply be due to a failure of the published manuscripts to include—and the publisher to require— comprehensive information on experimental design, methods, reagents, or the in vitro and in vivo systems under study. Failure to accurately reproduce all environmental influences on an experiment, particularly those using animals, also contributes to inability to repeat novel findings. The most common reason for failures of reproducibility may well bein the rigor and transparency with which methodology is described by authors. Another reason may be the reluctance by more established investigators to break with traditional methods of data presentation. However, one size does not fit all when it comes to data presentation, particularly because of the wide variety of data formats presented in individual disciplines represented by journals. Thus, some flexibility needs to be allowed. The American Physiological Society (APS) has made available guidelines for transparent reporting that it recommends all authors follow(https://www.physiology.org/author-info.promoting-transparent-reporting) (https://www.physiology.org/author-info.experimental-details-to-report). These are just some of the efforts being made to facilitate the communication of discovery in a transparent manner, which complement what has been a strength of the discipline for many years—the ability of the scientists and scientific literature to self-correct (8).

      We describe a project-based introduction to reproducible and collaborative neuroimaging analysis. Traditional teaching on neuroimaging usually consists of a series of lectures that emphasize the big picture rather than the foundations on which the techniques are based. The lectures are often paired with practical workshops in which students run imaging analyses using the graphical interface of specific neuroimaging software packages. Our experience suggests that this combination leaves the student with a superficial understanding of the underlying ideas, and an informal, inefficient, and inaccurate approach to analysis. To address these problems, we based our course around a substantial open-ended group project. This allowed us to teach: (a) computational tools to ensure computationally reproducible work, such as the Unix command line, structured code, version control, automated testing, and code review and (b) a clear understanding of the statistical techniques used for a basic analysis of a single run in an MR scanner. The emphasis we put on the group project showed the importance of standard computational tools for accuracy, efficiency, and collaboration. The projects were broadly successful in engaging students in working reproducibly on real scientific questions. We propose that a course on this model should be the foundation for future programs in neuroimaging. We believe it will also serve as a model for teaching efficient and reproducible research in other fields of computational science.

      Experimental deception has not been seriously examined in terms of its impact on reproducible science. I demonstrate, using data from the Open Science Collaboration’s Reproducibility Project (2015), that experiments involving deception have a higher probability of not replicating and have smaller effect sizes compared to experiments that do not have deception procedures. This trend is possibly due to missing information about the context and performance of agents in the studies in which the original effects were generated, leading to either compromised internal validity, or an incomplete specification and control of variables in replication studies. Of special interest are the mechanisms by which deceptions are implemented and how these present challenges for the efficient transmission of critical information from experimenter to participant. I rehearse possible frameworks that might form the basis of a future research program on experimental deception and make some recommendations as to how such a program might be initiated.

      Results from cognitive neuroscience have been cited as evidence in courtrooms around the world, and their admissibility has been a challenge for the legal system. Unfortunately, the recent reproducibility crisis in cognitive neuroscience, showing that the published studies in cognitive neuroscience may not be as trustworthy as expected, has made the situation worse. Here we analysed how the irreproducible results in cognitive neuroscience literature could compromise the standards for admissibility of scientific evidence, and pointed out how the open science movement may help to alleviate these problems. We conclude that open science not only benefits the scientific community but also the legal system, and society in a broad sense. Therefore, we suggest both scientists and practitioners follow open science recommendations and uphold the best available standards in order to serve as good gatekeepers in their own fields. Moreover, scientists and practitioners should collaborate closely to maintain an effective functioning of the entire gatekeeping system of the law.

      An increasing number of studies, surveys, and editorials highlight experimental and computational reproducibility and replication issues that appear to pervade most areas of modern science. This perspective examines some of the multiple and complex causes of what has been called a "reproducibility crisis," which can impact materials, interface/(bio)interphase, and vacuum sciences. Reproducibility issues are not new to science, but they are now appearing in new forms requiring innovative solutions. Drivers include the increasingly multidiscipline, multimethod nature of much advanced science, increased complexity of the problems and systems being addressed, and the large amounts and multiple types of experimental and computational data being collected and analyzed in many studies. Sustained efforts are needed to address the causes of reproducibility problems that can hinder the rate of scientific progress and lower public and political regard for science. The initial efforts of the American Vacuum Society to raise awareness of a new generation of reproducibility challenges and provide tools to help address them serve as examples of mitigating actions that can be undertaken.

      Reproducibility of modeling is a problem that exists for any machine learning practitioner, whether in industry or academia. The consequences of an irreproducible model can include significant financial costs, lost time, and even loss of personal reputation (if results prove unable to be replicated). This paper will first discuss the problems we have encountered while building a variety of machine learning models, and subsequently describe the framework we built to tackle the problem of model reproducibility. The framework is comprised of four main components (data, feature, scoring, and evaluation layers), which are themselves comprised of well defined transformations. This enables us to not only exactly replicate a model, but also to reuse the transformations across different models. As a result, the platform has dramatically increased the speed of both offline and online experimentation while also ensuring model reproducibility.

      The drive for reproducibility in the computational sciences has provoked discussion and effort across a broad range of perspectives: technological, legislative/policy, education, and publishing. Discussion on these topics is not new, but the need to adopt standards for reproducibility of claims made based on computational results is now clear to researchers, publishers and policymakers alike. Many technologies exist to support and promote reproduction of computational results: containerisation tools like Docker, literate programming approaches such as Sweave, knitr, iPython or cloud environments like Amazon Web Services. But these technologies are tied to specific programming languages (e.g. Sweave/knitr to R; iPython to Python) or to platforms (e.g. Docker for 64-bit Linux environments only). To date, no single approach is able to span the broad range of technologies and platforms represented in computational biology and biotechnology. To enable reproducibility across computational biology, we demonstrate an approach and provide a set of tools that is suitable for all computational work and is not tied to a particular programming language or platform. We present published examples from a series of papers in different areas of computational biology, spanning the major languages and technologies in the field (Python/R/MATLAB/Fortran/C/Java). Our approach produces a transparent and flexible process for replication and recomputation of results. Ultimately, its most valuable aspect is the decoupling of methods in computational biology from their implementation. Separating the 'how' (method) of a publication from the 'where' (implementation) promotes genuinely open science and benefits the scientific community as a whole.

      With concerns over research reproducibility on the rise, systematic replications of published science have become an important tool to estimate the replicability of findings in specific areas. Nevertheless, such initiatives are still uncommon in biomedical science, and have never been performed at a national level. The Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative is a multicenter, systematic effort to assess the reproducibility of the country’s biomedical research by replicating between 50 and 100 experiments from Brazilian life sciences articles. The project will focus on a set of common laboratory methods, performing each experiment in multiple institutions across the country, with the reproducibility of published findings analyzed in the light of interlaboratory variability. The results, due in 2021, will allow us not only to estimate the reproducibility of Brazilian biomedical science, but also to investigate if there are aspects of the published literature that can be used to predict it.

ReQuEST (Reproducible Quality-Efficient Systems Tournament) exploits the open-source. Collective Knowledge framework (CK) to unify benchmarking, optimization, and co-design of deep learning systems implementations and exchange results via a live multi-objective scoreboard. Systems evaluated under ReQuEST are diverse and include an FPGA-based accelerator, optimized deep learning libraries for x86 and ARM systems, and distributed inference in Amazon Cloud and over a cluster of Raspberry Pis. We finally discuss limitations to our approach, and how we plan improve upon those limitations for the upcoming SysML artifact evaluation effort.

          Evaluating the computational reproducibility of data analysis pipelines has become a critical issue. It is, however, a cumbersome process for analyses that involve data from large populations of subjects, due to their computational and storage requirements. We present a method to predict the computational reproducibility of data analysis pipelines in large population studies. We formulate the problem as a collaborative filtering process, with constraints on the construction of the training set. We propose 6 different strategies to build the training set, which we evaluate on 2 datasets, a synthetic one modeling a population with a growing number of subject types, and a real one obtained with neuroinformatics pipelines. Results show that one sampling method, "Random File Numbers (Uniform)" is able to predict computational reproducibility with a good accuracy. We also analyze the relevance of including file and subject biases in the collaborative filtering model. We conclude that the proposed method is able to speedup reproducibility evaluations substantially, with a reduced accuracy loss.

          Neuroscience has been carried into the domain of big data and high performance computing (HPC) on the backs of initiatives in data collection and an increasingly compute-intensive tools. While managing HPC experiments requires considerable technical acumen, platforms and standards have been developed to ease this burden on scientists. While web-portals make resources widely accessible, data organizations such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure and tool description languages such as Boutiques provide researchers with a foothold to tackle these problems using their own datasets, pipelines, and environments. While these standards lower the barrier to adoption of HPC and cloud systems for neuroscience applications, they still require the consolidation of disparate domain-specific knowledge. We present Clowdr, a lightweight tool to launch experiments on HPC systems and clouds, record rich execution records, and enable the accessible sharing of experimental summaries and results. Clowdr uniquely sits between web platforms and bare-metal applications for experiment management by preserving the flexibility of do-it-yourself solutions while providing a low barrier for developing, deploying and disseminating neuroscientific analysis.

     In scientometrics, we have not yet had an intensive debate about the reproducibility of research published in our field, although concerns about  a  lack  of  reproducibility  have occasionally surfaced (see e.g. Glänzel & Schöpflin 1994 and Van den Besselaar et al. 2017), and the need to improve the reproducibility is used as an important argument for open citation data  (see www.issi-society.org/open-citations-letter/).  We  initiated  a  first  discussion  about reproducibility  in  scientometrics  with  a  workshop  at  ISSI  2017  in  Wuhan. One of the outcomes was the sense that scientific fields differ with regard to the type and pervasiveness of  threats to the reproducibility  of  their  published  research,  last  but  not  least  due  to  their differences in modes of knowledge production, such as confirmatory versus exploratory study designs, and differences in methods and empirical objects.

     Methodological developments and software implementations progress in increasingly faster time-frames. The introduction and widespread acceptance of pre-print archived reports and open-source software make state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers more and more emphasize that their results should be reproducible (using the same data obtaining the same results), which is a basic requirement for assessing the replicability (obtaining similar results in new data) of results. While the age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility, it also undermines it in ways not often realized by researchers. The goal of this paper is to make researchers aware of these caveats. I discuss sources of limited replicability and reproducibility in both the development of novel statistical methods and their implementation in software routines. Novel methodology comes with many researcher degrees of freedom, and new understanding comes with changing standards over time.  In software-development, reproducibility may be impacted due to software developing and changing over time, a problem that is greatly magnified by large dependency-trees between software-packages. The paper concludes with a list of recommendations for both developers and users of new methods to improve reproducibility of results.

     We developed a new probabilistic model to assess the impact of recommendations rectifying the reproducibility crisis (by publishing both positive and 'negative' results and increasing statistical power) on competing objectives, such as discovering causal relationships, avoiding publishing false positive results, and reducing resource consumption. In contrast to recent publications our model quantifies the impact of each single suggestion not only for an individual study but especially their relation and consequences for the overall scientific process. We can prove that higher-powered experiments can save resources in the overall research process without generating excess false positives. The better the quality of the pre-study information and its exploitation, the more likely this beneficial effect is to occur. Additionally, we quantify the adverse effects of both neglecting good practices in the design and conduct of hypotheses-based research, and the omission of the publication of 'negative' findings. Our contribution is a plea for adherence to or reinforcement of the good scientific practice and publication of 'negative' findings.

     In recent years, serious concerns have arisen about reproducibility in science. Estimates of the cost of irreproducible preclinical studies range from 28 billion USD per year in the USA alone (Freedman et al. in PLoS Biol 13(6):e1002165, 2015) to over 200 billion USD per year worldwide (Chalmers and Glasziou in Lancet 374:86–89, 2009). The situation in the social sciences is not very different: Reproducibility in psychological research, for example, has been estimated to be below 50% as well (Open Science Collaboration in Science 349:6251, 2015). Less well studied is the issue of reproducibility of simulation research. A few replication studies of agent-based models, however, suggest the problem for computational modeling may be more severe than for laboratory experiments (Willensky and Rand in JASSS 10(4):2, 2007; Donkin et al. in Environ Model Softw 92:142–151, 2017; Bajracharya and Duboz in: Proceedings of the symposium on theory of modeling and simulation—DEVS integrative M&S symposium, pp 6–11, 2013). In this perspective, we discuss problems of reproducibility in agent-based simulations of life and social science problems, drawing on best practices research in computer science and in wet-lab experiment design and execution to suggest some ways to improve simulation research practice.

     The results of a scientific experiment have to be reproduced to be valid. The scientific method is well known in experimental sciences but it is not always the case for computer scientists. Recent publications and studies has shown that there is a significant reproducibility crisis in Biology and Medicine. This problem has also been demonstrated for hundreds of publications in computer science where only a limited set of publication results could be reproduced. In this paper we present the reproducibility challenge and we examine the reproducibility of a Parallel Discrete Event System Specification (PDEVS) model with two different execution frameworks.

     Scientific reproducibility is key to the advancement of science as researchers can build on sound and validated results to design new research studies. However, recent studies in biomedical research have highlighted key challenges in scientific reproducibility as more than 70% of researchers in a survey of more than 1500 participants were not able to reproduce results from other groups and 50% of researchers were not able to reproduce their own experiments. Provenance metadata is a key component of scientific reproducibility and as part of the Provenance for Clinical and Health Research (ProvCaRe) project, we have: (1) identified and modeled important provenance terms associated with a biomedical research study in the S3 model (formalized in the ProvCaRe ontology); (2) developed a new natural language processing (NLP) workflow to identify and extract provenance metadata from published articles describing biomedical research studies; and (3) developed the ProvCaRe knowledge repository to enable users to query and explore provenance of research studies using the S3 model. However, a key challenge in this project is the automated classification of provenance metadata extracted by the NLP workflow according to the S3 model and its subsequent querying in the ProvCaRe knowledge repository. In this paper, we describe the development and comparative evaluation of deep learning techniques for multi-class classification of structured provenance metadata extracted from biomedical literature using 12 different categories of provenance terms represented in the S3 model. We describe the application of the Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) network, which has the highest classification accuracy of 86% in our evaluation, to classify more than 48 million provenance triples in the ProvCaRe knowledge repository (available at: https://provcare.case.edu/).

     If the results in a published study can’t be replicated in subsequent experiments, how can you trust what you read in scientific journals? One international group of researchers is well aware of this reproducibility crisis, and has been striving to hold scientists accountable. For their most recent test, they attempted to reproduce 21 studies from two of the top scientific journals, Science and Nature, that were published between 2010 and 2015. Only 13 of the reproductions produced the same results as the original study.

     We refer to the recent guidelines for experimental models of myocardial ischemia and infarction [279], and aim to provide now practical guidelines to ensure rigor and reproducibility in preclinical and clinical studies on cardioprotection. In line with the above guidelines [279], we define rigor as standardized state-of-the-art design, conduct and reporting of a study, which is then a prerequisite for reproducibility, i.e. replication of results by another laboratory when performing exactly the same experiment.

     The paucity of major scientific breakthroughs leading to new or improved treatments, and the inability to identify valid and reproducible biomarkers that improve clinical management, has produced a crisis in confidence in the validity of our pathogenic theories and the reproducibility of our research findings. This crisis in turn has driven changes in standards for research methodologies and prompted calls for the creation of open‐access data repositories and the preregistration of research hypotheses. Although we should embrace the creation of repositories and registries, and the promise for greater statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of research findings they afford, we should also recognize that they alone are no substitute for sound design in minimizing study confounds, and they are no guarantor of faith in the validity of our pathogenic theories, findings, and biomarkers. One way, and maybe the only sure way, of knowing that we have a valid understanding of brain processes and disease mechanisms in human studies is by experimentally manipulating variables and predicting its effects on outcome measures and biomarkers.

tags: [reproducible paper, ReproZip]
description: |
     Reproducibility in the computational sciences has been stymied because of the complex and rapidly changing computational environments in which modern research takes place. While many will espouse reproducibility as a value, the challenge of making it happen (both for themselves and testing the reproducibility of others' work) often outweigh the benefits. There have been a few reproducibility solutions designed and implemented by the community. In particular, the authors are contributors to ReproZip, a tool to enable computational reproducibility by tracing and bundling together research in the environment in which it takes place (e.g. one's computer or server). In this white paper, we introduce a tool for unpacking ReproZip bundles in the cloud, ReproServer. ReproServer takes an uploaded ReproZip bundle (.rpz file) or a link to a ReproZip bundle, and users can then unpack them in the cloud via their browser, allowing them to reproduce colleagues' work without having to install anything locally. This will help lower the barrier to reproducing others' work, which will aid reviewers in verifying the claims made in papers and reusing previously published research.

    Since our debut in late 2006, PLOS ONE has strived to promote best practices in research reporting as a way to improve reproducibility in research. We have supported initiatives towards increased transparency, as well as the gathering of evidence that can inform improvements in the quality of reporting in research articles. In line with this commitment, PLOS ONE collaborated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the impact of an intervention asking authors to complete a reporting checklist at the time of manuscript submission. The results from this trial have recently been posted on bioRxiv (1) and provide a further step toward building the necessary evidence base to inform editorial interventions towards improving reporting quality.

    The Open Science Framework (OSF) has the mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility in research. The Journal of Neurochemistry became a signatory of their Transparency and Openness guidelines in 2016, which provides eight modular standards (Citation standards, Data Transparency, Analytic Methods/Code Transparency, Research Materials Transparency, Design and Analysis Transparency, Study Pre‐registration, Analysis Plan Transparency, Replication) with increasing levels of stringency. Furthermore, OSF recommends and offers a collection of practices intended to make scientific processes and results more transparent and available in a standardized way for reuse to people outside the research team. It includes making research materials, data, and laboratory procedures freely accessible online to anyone. This editorial announces the decision of the Journal of Neurochemistry to introduce Open Science Badges, maintained by the Open Science Badges Committee and by the Center for Open Science (COS). The Open Science Badges, visual icons placed on publications, certify that an open practice was followed and signal to readers that an author has shared the corresponding research evidence, thus, allowing an independent researcher to understand how to reproduce the procedure.

    Data sharing is increasingly recommended as a means of accelerating science by facilitating collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility. While few oppose data sharing philosophically, a range of barriers deter most researchers from implementing it in practice. To justify the significant effort required for sharing data, funding agencies, institutions, and investigators need clear evidence of benefit. Here, using the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative, we present a case study that provides direct evidence of the impact of open sharing on brain imaging data use and resulting peer-reviewed publications. We demonstrate that openly shared data can increase the scale of scientific studies conducted by data contributors, and can recruit scientists from a broader range of disciplines. These findings dispel the myth that scientific findings using shared data cannot be published in high-impact journals, suggest the transformative power of data sharing for accelerating science, and underscore the need for implementing data sharing universally.

  With contributions from the global natural product (NP) research community, and continuing the Raw Data Initiative, this review collects a comprehensive demonstration of the immense scientific value of disseminating raw nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, independently of, and in parallel with, classical publishing outlets. A comprehensive compilation of historic to present-day cases as well as contemporary and future applications show that addressing the urgent need for a repository of publicly accessible raw NMR data has the potential to transform natural products (NPs) and associated fields of chemical and biomedical research. The call for advancing open sharing mechanisms for raw data is intended to enhance the transparency of experimental protocols, augment the reproducibility of reported outcomes, including biological studies, become a regular component of responsible research, and thereby enrich the integrity of NP research and related fields.

  In this  paper  we  present  a  software  tool  for  elicitation  and  management  of  process  metadata.   It  follows  our  previously  published design idea of an assistant for researchers that aims at minimizing the additional effort required for producing a sustainable workflow documentation.   With  the  ever-growing  number  of  linguistic  resources  available,  it  also  becomes  increasingly  important  to  provide proper  documentation  to  make  them  comparable  and  to  allow  meaningful  evaluations  for  specific  use  cases.   The  often  prevailing practice  of  post  hoc  documentation  of  resource  generation  or  research  processes  bears  the  risk  of  information  loss.   Not  only  does detailed documentation of a process aid in achieving reproducibility, it also increases usefulness of the documented work for others as a cornerstone of good scientific practice.  Time pressure together with the lack of simple documentation methods leads to workflow documentation in practice being an arduous and often neglected task. Our tool ensures a clean documentation for common workflows in natural language processing and digital humanities. Additionally, it can easily be integrated into existing institutional infrastructures.

  This article provides recommendations for writing empirical journal articles that enable transparency, reproducibility, clarity, and memorability. Recommendations for transparency include preregistering methods, hypotheses, and analyses; submitting registered reports; distinguishing confirmation from exploration; and showing your warts. Recommendations for reproducibility include documenting methods and results fully and cohesively, by taking advantage of open-science tools, and citing sources responsibly. Recommendations for clarity include writing short paragraphs, composed of short sentences; writing comprehensive abstracts; and seeking feedback from a naive audience. Recommendations for memorability include writing narratively; embracing the hourglass shape of empirical articles; beginning articles with a hook; and synthesizing, rather than Mad Libbing, previous literature.

   Many have raised concerns about the reproducibility of biomedical research. In this Perspective, the authors address this "reproducibility crisis" by distilling discussions around reproducibility into a simple guide to facilitate understanding of the topic.Reproducibility applies both within and across studies. The following questions address reproducibility within studies: "Within a study, if the investigator repeats the data management and analysis will she get an identical answer?" and "Within a study, if someone else starts with the same raw data, will she draw a similar conclusion?" Contrastingly, the following questions address reproducibility across studies: "If someone else tries to repeat an experiment as exactly as possible, will she draw a similar conclusion?" and "If someone else tries to perform a similar study, will she draw a similar conclusion?"Many elements of reproducibility from clinical trials can be applied to preclinical research (e.g., changing the culture of preclinical research to focus more on transparency and rigor). For investigators, steps toward improving reproducibility include specifying data analysis plans ahead of time to decrease selective reporting, more explicit data management and analysis protocols, and increasingly detailed experimental protocols, which allow others to repeat experiments. Additionally, senior investigators should take greater ownership of the details of their research (e.g., implementing active laboratory management practices, such as random audits of raw data [or at least reduced reliance on data summaries], more hands-on time overseeing experiments, and encouraging a healthy skepticism from all contributors). These actions will support a culture where rigor + transparency = reproducibility.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

  This presentation to LERU workshop: Nurturing a Culture of Responsible Research in the Era of Open Science considered the issue of the credibility of science being in question in a 'post-truth' world and how reproducibility is adding to the problem. Open Science offers a solution, but it is not easy to implement, particularly by research institutions. The main issues relate to language used in the open space, that solutions look different to different disciplines, that researchers are often feeling "under siege" and that we need to reward good open practice.

  Most scientific papers are not reproducible: it is really hard, if not impossible, to understand how results are derived from data, and being able to regenerate them in the future (even by the same researchers). However, traceability and reproducibility of results are indispensable elements of highquality science, and an increasing requirement of many journals and funding sources. Reproducible studies include code able to regenerate results from the original data. This practice not only provides a perfect record of the whole analysis but also reduces the probability of errors and facilitates code reuse, thus accelerating scientific progress. But doing reproducible science also brings many benefits to the individual researcher, including saving time and effort, improved collaborations, and higher quality and impact of final publications. In this article we introduce reproducible science, why it is important, and how we can improve the reproducibility of our work. We introduce principles and tools for data management, analysis, version control, and software management that help us achieve reproducible workflows in the context of ecology.

  This article uses the framework of Ioannidis (2005) to organise a discussion of issues related to the ‘reproducibility crisis’. It then goes on to use that framework to evaluate various proposals to fix the problem. Of particular interest is the ‘post‐study probability’, the probability that a reported research finding represents a true relationship. This probability is inherently unknowable. However, a number of insightful results emerge if we are willing to make some conjectures about reasonable parameter values. Among other things, this analysis demonstrates the important role that replication can play in improving the signal value of empirical research.

  The reproducibility crisis, that is, the fact that many scientific results are difficult to replicate, pointing to their unreliability or falsehood, is a hot topic in the recent scientific literature, and statistical methodologies, testing procedures and p‐values, in particular, are at the centre of the debate. Assessment of the extent of the problem–the reproducibility rate or the false discovery rate–and the role of contributing factors are still an open problem. Replication experiments, that is, systematic replications of existing results, may offer relevant information on these issues. We propose a statistical model to deal with such information, in particular to estimate the reproducibility rate and the effect of some study characteristics on its reliability. We analyse data from a recent replication experiment in psychology finding a reproducibility rate broadly coherent with other assessments from the same experiment. Our results also confirm the expected role of some contributing factor (unexpectedness of the result and room for bias) while they suggest that the similarity between original study and the replica is not so relevant, thus mitigating some criticism directed to replication experiments.

  When computational experiments include only datasets, they could be shared through the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) which point to these resources. However, experiments seldom include only datasets, but most often also include software, execution results, provenance, and other associated documentation. The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While an entire Research Object may be citable using a URI or a DOI, it is often desirable to cite specific sub-components of a research object to help identify, authorize, date, and retrieve the published sub-components of these objects. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate citations for sub-components of research objects by using the object’s recorded provenance traces. The generated citations can be used "as is" or taken as suggestions that can be grouped and combined to produce higher level citations.

  Bibliographic databases provide access to scientific literature through targeted queries. The most common uses of these services, aside from accessing scientific literature for personal use, are to find relevant citations for formal surveys of scientific literature, such as systematic reviews or meta-analysis, or to estimate the number of publications on a certain topic as a measure of sampling effort. Bibliographic search tools vary in the level of access to the scientific literature they allow. For instance, Google Scholar is a bibliographic search engine which allows users to find (but not necessarily access) scientific literature for no charge, whereas other services, such as Web of Science, are subscription based, allowing access to full texts of academic works at costs that can exceed $100,000 annually for large universities (Goodman 2005). One of the most commonly used bibliographic databases, Clarivate Analytics–produced Web of Science, offers tailored subscriptions to their citation indexing service. This flexibility allows subscriptions and resulting access to be tailored to the needs of researchers at the institution (Goodwin 2014). However, there are issues created by this differential access, which we discuss further below.

description: |
   A central tenet of reproducible research is that scientific results are published along with the underlying data and software code necessary to reproduce and verify the findings. A host of tools and software have been released that facilitate such work-flows and scientific journals have increasingly demanded that code and primary data be made available with publications. There has been little practical advice on implementing reproducible research work-flows for large ’omics’ or systems biology data sets used by teams of analysts working in collaboration. In such instances it is important to ensure all analysts use the same version of a data set for their analyses. Yet, instantiating relational databases and standard operating procedures can be unwieldy, with high "startup" costs and poor adherence to procedures when they deviate substantially from an analyst’s usual work-flow. Ideally a reproducible research work-flow should fit naturally into an individual’s existing work-flow, with minimal disruption. Here, we provide an overview of how we have leveraged popular open source tools, including Bioconductor, Rmarkdown, git version control, R, and specifically R’s package system combined with a new tool DataPackageR, to implement a lightweight reproducible research work-flow for preprocessing large data sets, suitable for sharing among small-to-medium sized teams of computational scientists. Our primary contribution is the DataPackageR tool, which decouples time-consuming data processing from data analysis while leaving a traceable record of how raw data is processed into analysis-ready data sets. The software ensures packaged data objects are properly documented and performs checksum verification of these along with basic package version management, and importantly, leaves a record of data processing code in the form of package vignettes. Our group has implemented this work-flow to manage, analyze and report on pre-clinical immunological trial data from multi-center, multi-assay studies for the past three years.

  Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers. Keshav (2012) provides a three-pass method to researchers to improve their reading skills. This article extends Keshav's method for reading a research compendium. Research compendia are an increasingly used form of publication, which packages not only the research paper's text and figures, but also all data and software for better reproducibility. We introduce the existing conventions for research compendia and suggest how to utilise their shared properties in a structured reading process. Unlike the original, this article is not build upon a long history but intends to provide guidance at the outset of an emerging practice.

  Teaching computational reproducibility for neuroimaging

tags: [reproducible paper]

  We describe a project-based introduction to reproducible and collaborative neuroimaging analysis. Traditional teaching on neuroimaging usually consists of a series of lectures that emphasize the big picture rather than the foundations on which the techniques are based. The lectures are often paired with practical workshops in which students run imaging analyses using the graphical interface of specific neu-roimaging software packages. Our experience suggests that this combination leaves the student with asuperficial understanding of the underlying ideas, and an informal, inefficient, and inaccurate approach to  analysis.   To  address  these  problems,  we  based  our  course  around a substantial  open-ended  group project.  This allowed us to teach:  (a) computational tools to ensure computationally reproducible work,such as the Unix command line, structured code, version control, automated testing, and code reviewand (b) a clear understanding of the statistical techniques used for a basic analysis of a single run in an MRI scanner.  The emphasis we put on the group project showed the importance of standard computational tools for accuracy, efficiency, and collaboration.  The projects were broadly successful in engagingstudents in working reproducibly on real scientific questions.  We propose that a course on this modelshould be the foundation for future programs in neuroimaging.  We believe it will also serve as a modelfor teaching efficient and reproducible research in other fields of computational science

  The RAMP (Rapid Analytics and Model Prototyping) is a software and project management tool developed by the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science. The original goal was to accelerate the adoption of high-quality data science solutions for domain science problems by running rapid collaborative prototyping sessions. Today it is a full-blown data science project management tool promoting reproducibility, fair and transparent model evaluation, and democratization of data science.  We have used the framework for setting up and solving about twenty scientific problems, for organizing scientific sub-communities around these events, and for training novice data scientists.

  Three Dimensions of Reproducibility in Natural Language Processing

  Despite considerable recent attention to problems with reproducibility of scientific research, there is a striking lack of agreement about the definition of the term. That is a problem, because the lack of a consensus definition makes it difficult to compare studies of reproducibility, and thus to have even a broad overview of the state of the issue in natural language processing. This paper proposes an ontology of reproducibility in that field. Its goal is to enhance both future research and communication about the topic, and retrospective meta-analyses. We show that three dimensions of reproducibility, corresponding to three kinds of claims in natural language processing papers, can account for a variety of types of research reports. These dimensions are reproducibility of a conclusion, of a finding, and of a value. Three biomedical natural language processing papers by the authors of this paper are analyzed with respect to these dimensions.

  The ability to independently regenerate published computational claims is widely recognized as a key component of scientific reproducibility. In this article we take a narrow interpretation of this goal, and attempt to regenerate published claims from author-supplied information, including data, code, inputs, and other provided specifications, on a different computational system than that used by the original authors. We are motivated by Claerbout and Donoho's exhortation of the importance of providing complete information for reproducibility of the published claim. We chose the Elsevier journal, the Journal of Computational Physics, which has stated author guidelines that encourage the availability of computational digital artifacts that support scholarly findings. In an IRB approved study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (IRB #17329) we gathered artifacts from a sample of authors who published in this journal in 2016 and 2017. We then used the ICERM criteria generated at the 2012 ICERM workshop "Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics" to evaluate the sufficiency of the information provided in the publications and the ease with which the digital artifacts afforded computational reproducibility. We find that, for the articles for which we obtained computational artifacts, we could not easily regenerate the findings for 67% of them, and we were unable to easily regenerate all the findings for any of the articles. We then evaluated the artifacts we did obtain (55 of 306 articles) and find that the main barriers to computational reproducibility are inadequate documentation of code, data, and workflow information (70.9%), missing code function and setting information, and missing licensing information (75%). We recommend improvements based on these findings, including the deposit of supporting digital artifacts for reproducibility as a condition of publication, and verification of computational findings via re-execution of the code when possible.

  Improving Reproducibility of Distributed Computational Experiments

  Conference and journal publications increasingly require experiments associated with a submitted article to be repeatable. Authors comply to this requirement by sharing all associated digital artifacts, i.e., code, data, and environment configuration scripts. To ease aggregation of the digital artifacts, several tools have recently emerged that automate the aggregation of digital artifacts by auditing an experiment execution and building a portable container of code, data, and environment. However, current tools only package non-distributed computational experiments. Distributed computational experiments must either be packaged manually or supplemented with sufficient documentation. In this paper, we outline the reproducibility requirements of distributed experiments using a distributed computational science experiment involving use of message-passing interface (MPI), and propose a general method for auditing and repeating distributed experiments. Using Sciunit we show how this method can be implemented. We validate our method with initial experiments showing application re-execution runtime can be improved by 63% with a trade-off of longer run-time on initial audit execution.

  We describe the four publications we have tried to make reproducible and discuss how each paper has changed our workflows, practices, and collaboration policies. The fundamental insight is that paper artifacts must be made reproducible from the start of the project; artifacts are too difficult to make reproducible when the papers are (1) already published and (2) authored by researchers that are not thinking about reproducibility. In this paper, we present the best practices adopted by our research laboratory, which was sculpted by the pitfalls we have identified for the Popper convention. We conclude with a "call-to-arms" for the community focused on enhancing reproducibility initiatives for academic conferences, industry environments, and national laboratories. We hope that our experiences will shape a best practices guide for future reproducible papers.

  A recent widespread realization that software experiments are not as easily replicated as once believed brought software execution preservation to the science spotlight. As a result, scientists, institutions, and funding agencies have recently been pushing for the development of methodologies and tools that preserve software artifacts. Despite current efforts, long term reproducibility still eludes us. In this paper, we present the requirements for software execution preservation and discuss how to improve long-term reproducibility in science. In particular, we discuss the reasons why preserving binaries and pre-built execution environments is not enough and why preserving the ability to replicate results is not the same as preserving software for reproducible science. Finally, we show how these requirements are supported by Occam, an open curation framework that fully preserves software and its dependencies from source to execution, promoting transparency, longevity, and re-use. Specifically, Occam provides the ability to automatically deploy workflows in a fully-functional environment that is able to not only run them, but make them easily replicable.

  Have researchers increased reporting of outliers in response to the reproducibility crisis?

description: |
  Psychology is currently experiencing a "renaissance" where the replication and reproducibility of published reports are at the forefront of conversations in the field. While researchers have worked to discuss possible problems and solutions, work has yet to uncover how this new culture may have altered reporting practices in the social sciences. As outliers can bias both descriptive and inferential statistics, the search for these data points is essential to any analysis using these parameters. We quantified the rates of reporting of outliers within psychology at two time points: 2012 when the replication crisis was born, and 2017, after the publication of reports concerning replication, questionable research practices, and transparency. A total of 2235 experiments were identified and analyzed, finding an increase in reporting of outliers from only 15.7% of experiments mentioning outliers in 2012 to 25.0% in 2017. We investigated differences across years given the psychological field or statistical analysis that experiment employed. Further, we inspected whether outliers mentioned are whole participant observations or data points, and what reasons authors gave for stating the observation was deviant. We conclude that while report rates are improving overall, there is still room for improvement in the reporting practices of psychological scientists which can only aid in strengthening our science.

  The Crisis of Reproducibility, the Denominator Problem and the Scientific Role of Multi-Scale Modeling

  The "Crisis of Reproducibility" has received considerable attention both within the scientific community and without. While factors associated with scientific culture and practical practice are most often invoked, I propose that the Crisis of Reproducibility is ultimately a failure of generalization with a fundamental scientific basis in the methods used for biomedical research. The Denominator Problem describes how limitations intrinsic to the two primary approaches of biomedical research, clinical studies and pre-clinical experimental biology, lead to an inability to effectively characterize the full extent of biological heterogeneity, which compromises the task of generalizing acquired knowledge. Drawing on the example of the unifying role of theory in the physical sciences, I propose that multi-scale mathematical and dynamic computational models, when mapped to the modular structure of biological systems, can serve a unifying role as formal representations of what is conserved and similar from one biological context to another. This ability to explicitly describe the generation of heterogeneity from similarity addresses the Denominator Problem and provides a scientific response to the Crisis of Reproducibility.

  In 1942, Robert Merton wrote that "Incipient and actual attacks upon the integrity of science" meant that science needed to "restate its objectives, seek out its rationale". Some 77 years later we are similarly in an environment where “the people of this country have had enough of experts". It is essential that science is able to withstand rigorous scrutiny to avoid being dismissed, pilloried or ignored. Transparency and reproducibility in the scientific process is a mechanism to meet this challenge and good research data management is a fundamental factor in this.

   Replication is the scientific gold standard that enables the confirmation of research findings. Concerns related to publication bias, flexibility in data analysis, and high-profile cases of academic misconduct have led to recent calls for more replication and systematic accumulation of scientific knowledge in psychological science. This renewed emphasis on replication may pose specific challenges to cross-cultural research due to inherent practical difficulties in emulating an original study in other cultural groups. The purpose of the present article is to discuss how the core concepts of this replication debate apply to cross-cultural psychology. Distinct to replications in cross-cultural research are examinations of bias and equivalence in manipulations and procedures, and that targeted research populations may differ in meaningful ways. We identify issues in current psychological research (analytic flexibility, low power) and possible solutions (preregistration, power analysis), and discuss ways to implement best practices in cross-cultural replication attempts.

   Scientific instruments are at the heart of the scientific process, from 17th‐century telescopes and microscopes, to modern particle colliders and DNA sequencing machines. Nowadays, most scientific instruments in biomedical research come from commercial suppliers [1], [2], and yet, compared to the biopharmaceutical and medical devices industries, little is known about the interactions between scientific instrument makers and academic researchers. Our research suggests that this knowledge gap is a cause for concern.

   The lack of standard terminology means that we do not clearly distinguish between situations in which there is not enough information to attempt repetition, and those in which attempts do not yield substantially the same outcome. To reduce confusion, I propose an intuitive, unambiguous neologism: ‘preproducibility’. An experiment or analysis is preproducible if it has been described in adequate detail for others to undertake it. Preproducibility is a prerequisite for reproducibility, and the idea makes sense across disciplines.

   A fundamental challenge for open science is how best to create and share documents containing computational results. Traditional methods involve maintaining the code, generated tables and figures, and text as separate files and manually assembling them into a finished document. As projects grow in complexity, this approach can lead to procedures which are error prone and hard to replicate. Fortunately, new tools are emerging to address this problem and librarians who provide data services are ideally positioned to provide training. In the workshop we’ll use RStudio to demonstrate how to create a "compilable" document containing all the text elements (including bibliography), as well as the code required to create embedded graphs and tables. We’ll demonstrate how the process facilitates making revisions when, for example, a reviewer has suggested a revision or when there has been a change in the underlying data. We’ll also demonstrate the convenience of integrating version control into the workflow using RStudio’s built-in support for git.

   When scientists are able to recreate earlier research results, published by other scientists, the research is considered reproducible. But what happens when the results don’t match? It means that the initial research is non-reproducible. Reproducibility, or non-reproducibility, of scientific experiments seems straightforward; it implies that an experimental result is either valid or invalid. In fact, researchers affiliated with Stanford University, Tufts University, and University of Ioannina in Greece concluded in 2005 that a majority of all research findings are false. How do those invalid results end up in scientific papers? A group of Stanford researchers concluded that, in many cases, bias is to blame.

   We introduce DeepDIVA: an infrastructure designed to enable quick and intuitive setup of reproducible experiments with a large range of useful analysis functionality. Reproducing scientific results can be a frustrating experience, not only in document image analysis but in machine learning in general. Using DeepDIVA a researcher can either reproduce a given experiment with a very limited amount of information or share their own experiments with others. Moreover, the framework offers a large range of functions, such as boilerplate code, keeping track of experiments, hyper-parameter optimization, and visualization of data and results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, this paper presents case studies in the area of handwritten document analysis where researchers benefit from the integrated functionality. DeepDIVA is implemented in Python and uses the deep learning framework PyTorch. It is completely open source, and accessible as Web Service through DIVAServices.

   Open access to research data increases knowledge, advances science, and benefits society. Many researchers are now required to share data. Two research centers at Yale have launched projects that support this mission. Both centers have developed technology, policies, and workflows to facilitate open access to data in their respective fields. The Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project at the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation advocates for the responsible sharing of clinical research data. The Project, which began in 2014, is committed to open science and data transparency, and supports research attempting to produce concrete benefits to patients, the medical community, and society as a whole. Early experience sharing data, made available by Johnson & Johnson (J&J) through the YODA Project, has demonstrated a demand for shared clinical research data as a resource for investigators. To date, the YODA Project has facilitated the sharing of data for over 65 research projects. The Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS) Data Archive is a digital repository that shares and preserves the research produced by scholars affiliated with ISPS. Since its launch in 2011, the Archive holds data and code underlying almost 90 studies. The Archive is committed to the ideals of scientific reproducibility and transparency: It provides free and public access to research materials and accepts content for distribution under a Creative Commons license. The Archive has pioneered a workflow, “curating for reproducibility,” that ensures long term usability and data quality.

  In the years since the launch of the World Wide Web in 1993, there have been profoundly transformative changes to the entire concept of publishing—exceeding all the previous combined technical advances of the centuries following the introduction of movable type in medieval Asia around the year 10001 and the subsequent large-scale commercialization of printing several centuries later by J. Gutenberg (circa 1440). Periodicals in print—from daily newspapers to scholarly journals—are now quickly disappearing, never to return, and while no publishing sector has been unaffected, many scholarly journals are almost unrecognizable in comparison with their counterparts of two decades ago. To say that digital delivery of the written word is fundamentally different is a huge understatement. Online publishing permits inclusion of multimedia and interactive content that add new dimensions to what had been available in print-only renderings. As of this writing, the IEEE portfolio of journal titles comprises 59 online only2 (31%) and 132 that are published in both print and online. The migration from print to online is more stark than these numbers indicate because of the 132 periodicals that are both print and online, the print runs are now quite small and continue to decline. In short, most readers prefer to have their subscriptions fulfilled by digital renderings only.

   Unless you’ve been living under a rock (no judgment, by the way), I’m sure you’ve heard about the reproducibility crisis in scientific research. In 2016, two posts on this blog covered what the main causes of irreproducibility are and what can be done, and how we can reform scientific publishing to value integrity. To briefly recap, a study published in PLOS biology noted that half of preclinical research is not reproducible. The estimated price tag on this irreproducibility is alarming—a whopping $28 billion. In my opinion, however, the most troubling cost of this crisis is its impact on public trust in science.

  Reproducibility is an important concern in all areas of computation. As such, computational reproducibility is receiving increasing interest from a variety of parties who are concerned with different aspects of computational reproducibility. Computational reproducibility encompasses several concerns including the sharing of code and data, as well as reproducible numerical results which may depend on operating system, tools, levels of parallelism, and numerical effects. In addition, the publication of reproducible computational results motivates a host of computational reproducibility concerns that arise from the fundamental notion of reproducibility of scientific results that has normally been restricted to experimental science. This workshop combines the Numerical Reproducibility at Exascale Workshops (conducted in 2015 and 2016 at SC) and the panel on Reproducibility held at SC16 (originally a BOF at SC15) to address several different issues in reproducibility that arise when computing at exascale. The workshop will include issues of numerical reproducibility as well as approaches and best practices to sharing and running code.

  Figures are essential outputs of computational geoscientific research, e.g. maps and time series showing the results of spatiotemporal analyses. They also play a key role in open reproducible research, where public access is provided to paper, data, and source code to enable reproduction of the reported results. This scientific ideal is rarely practiced as studies, e.g. in biology have shown. In this article, we report on a series of studies to evaluate open reproducible research in the geosciences from the perspectives of authors and readers. First, we asked geoscientists what they understand by open reproducible research and what hinders its realisation. We found there is disagreement amongst authors, and a lack of openness impedes the adoption by authors and readers alike. However, reproducible research also includes the ability to achieve the same results requiring not only accessible but executable source code. Hence, to further examine the reader’s perspective, we searched for open access papers from the geosciences that have code/data attached (in R) and executed the analysis. We encountered several technical issues while executing the code and found differences between the original and reproduced figures. Based on these findings, we propose guidelines for authors to address these.

  Estimating the Reproducibility of Experimental Philosophy

  For scientific theories grounded in empirical data, replicability is a core principle, for at least two reasons. First, unless we accept to have scientific theories rest on the authority of a small number of researchers, empirical studies should be replicable, in the sense that its methods and procedure should be detailed enough for someone else to conduct the same study. Second, for empirical results to provide a solid foundation for scientific theorizing, they should also be replicable, in the sense that most attempts at replicating the original study that produced them would yield similar results. The XPhi Replicability Project is primarily concerned with replicability in the second sense, that is: the replicability of results. In the past year, several projects have shed doubt on the replicability of key findings in psychology, and most notably social psychology. Because the methods of experimental philosophy have often been close to the ones used in social psychology, it is only natural to wonder to which extent the results experimental philosophers ground their theory are replicable. The aim of the XPhi Replicability Project is precisely to reach a reliable estimate of the replicability of empirical results in experimental philosophy. To this end, several research teams across the world will replicate around 40 studies in experimental philosophy, some among the most cited, others drawn at random. The results of the project will be published in a special issue of the Review of Philosophy and Psychology dedicated to the topic of replicability in cognitive science.

  Developer Interaction Traces backed by IDE Screen Recordings from Think aloud Sessions

  There are two well-known difficulties to test and interpret methodologies for mining developer interaction traces: first, the lack of enough large datasets needed by mining or machine learning approaches to provide reliable results; and second, the lack of "ground truth" or empirical evidence that can be used to triangulate the results, or to verify their accuracy and correctness. Moreover, relying solely on interaction traces limits our ability to take into account contextual factors that can affect the applicability of mining techniques in other contexts, as well hinders our ability to fully understand the mechanics behind observed phenomena. The data presented in this paper attempts to alleviate these challenges by providing 600+ hours of developer interaction traces, from which 26+ hours are backed with video recordings of the IDE screen and developer’s comments. This data set is relevant to researchers interested in investigating program comprehension, and those who are developing techniques for interaction traces analysis and mining.

  Reproducibility does not imply, innovation speeds up, and epistemic diversity optimizes discovery of truth in a model-centric meta-scientific framework

description: |
  Theoretical work on reproducibility of scientific claims has hitherto focused on hypothesis testing as the desired mode of statistical inference.  Focusing on hypothesis testing, however, poses a challenge to identify salient properties of the scientific process related to reproducibility, especially for fields that progress by building, comparing, selecting, and re-building models.  We build a model-centric meta-scientific framework in which scientific discovery progresses by confirming models proposed in idealized experiments.  In a temporal stochastic process of scientific discovery, we define scientists with diverse research strategies who search the true model generating the data.  When there is no replication in the system, the structure of scientific discovery is a particularly simple Markov chain.  We analyze the effect of diversity of research strategies in the scientific community and the complexity of the true model on the time spent at each model, the mean first time to hit the true model and staying with the true model, and the rate of reproducibility given a true model.  Inclusion of replication in the system   breaks the Markov property and fundamentally alters the structure of scientific discovery.  In this case, we analyze aforementioned properties of scientific discovery by an agent-based model.  In our system, the seeming paradox of scientific progress despite irreproducibility persists even in the absence of questionable research practices and incentive structures, as the rate of reproducibility and scientific discovery of the truth are uncorrelated.  We explain this seeming paradox by a combination of research strategies in the population and the state of truth.  Further, we find that innovation speeds up the discovery of truth by making otherwise inaccessible, possibly true models visible to the scientific population.  We also show that epistemic diversity in the scientific population optimizes across a range of desirable properties of scientific discovery.

  The safest solution would be to store copies of every object, ever created during the data analysis. All forks, wrong paths, everything. Along with detailed information which functions with what parameters were used to generate each result. Something like the ultimate TimeMachine or GitHub for R objects. With such detailed information, every analysis would be auditable and replicable. Right now the full tracking of all created objects is not possible without deep changes in the R interpreter. The archivist is the light-weight version of such solution.

  Questionable Research Practices in Ecology and Evolution

description: |
  We surveyed 807 researchers (494 ecologists and 313 evolutionary biologists) about their use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), including cherry picking statistically significant results, p hacking, and hypothesising after the results are known (HARKing). We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.

  Data availability, reusability, and analytic reproducibility: Evaluating the impact of a mandatory open data policy at the journal Cognition

  Access to research data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive, and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data ("analytic reproducibility"). To investigate, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25% pre-policy to 136/174, 78% post-policy), and data that were in-principle reusable (23/104, 22% pre-policy to 85/136, 62%, post-policy). However, for 35 articles with in-principle reusable data, the analytic reproducibility of target outcomes related to key findings was poor: 11 (31%) cases were reproducible without author assistance, 11 (31%) cases were reproducible only with author assistance, and 13 (37%) cases were not fully reproducible despite author assistance. Importantly, original conclusions did not appear to be seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification, and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.

  Here we present the Scientific Filesystem (SCIF), an organizational format that supports exposure of executables and metadata for discoverability of scientific applications. The format includes a known filesystem structure, a definition for a set of environment variables describing it, and functions for generation of the variables and interaction with the libraries, metadata, and executables located within. SCIF makes it easy to expose metadata, multiple environments, installation steps, files, and entrypoints to render scientific applications consistent, modular, and discoverable. A SCIF can be installed on a traditional host or in a container technology such as Docker or Singularity. We will start by reviewing the background and rationale for the Scientific Filesystem, followed by an overview of the specification, and the different levels of internal modules (“apps”) that the organizational format affords. Finally, we demonstrate that SCIF is useful by implementing and discussing several use cases that improve user interaction and understanding of scientific applications. SCIF is released along with a client and integration in the Singularity 2.4 software to quickly install and interact with Scientific Filesystems. When used inside of a reproducible container, a Scientific Filesystem is a recipe for reproducibility and introspection of the functions and users that it serves.

  A key component of scientific communication is sufficient information for other researchers in the field to reproduce published findings. For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26%. We find this policy—author remission of data and code postpublication upon request—an improvement over no policy, but currently insufficient for reproducibility.

  Graduate and undergraduate students involved in research projects that generate or analyze extensive datasets use several software applications for data input and processing subject to guidelines for ensuring data quality and availability. Data management guidelines are based on existing practices of the associated academic or funding institutions and may be automated to  minimize human error and maintenance overhead. This paper presents a framework for automating data management processes, and it details the flow of data from generation/acquisition through processing to the output of final reports. It is designed to adapt to changing requirements and limit overhead costs. The paper also presents a representative case study applying the framework to the finite element characterization of the magnetically coupled linear variable reluctance motor. It utilizes modern widely available scripting tools particularly Windows PowerShell® to automate workflows. This task requires generating motor characteristics for several thousands of operating conditions using finite element analysis.

   Science is conducted collaboratively, often requiring the sharing of knowledge about computational experiments. When experiments include only datasets, they can be shared using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). An experiment, however, seldom includes only datasets, but more often includes software, its past execution, provenance, and associated documentation. The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While a necessary method, mere aggregation is not sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments. Other users must be able to easily recompute on these shared research objects. Computational provenance is often the key to enable such reuse. In this paper, we show how reusable research objects can utilize provenance to correctly repeat a previous reference execution, to construct a subset of a research object for partial reuse, and to reuse existing contents of a research object for modified reuse. We describe two methods to summarize provenance that aid in understanding the contents and past executions of a research object. The first method obtains a process-view by collapsing low-level system information, and the second method obtains a summary graph by grouping related nodes and edges with the goal to obtain a graph view similar to application workflow. Through detailed experiments, we show the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms.

  While reproducibility has been a requirement in natural sciences for centuries, computational experiments have not followed the same standard. Often, there is insufficient information to reproduce computational results described in publications, and in the recent past, this has led to many retractions. Although scientists are aware of the numerous benefits of reproducibility, the perceived amount of work to make results reproducible is a significant disincentive. Fortunately, much of the information needed to reproduce an experiment can be obtained by systematically capturing its provenance. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of provenance and how they can be used to support reproducibility. We also describe a representative set of provenance tools and approaches that make it easy to create reproducible experiments.

  A heated debate surrounds the significance of reproducibility as an  indicator for research quality and reliability, with  many commentators linking a  "crisis of reproducibility" to the rise of fraudulent, careless and unreliable practices of knowledge production. Through the analysis of discourse and practices across research fields, I point out that reproducibility is not only interpreted in different ways, but also serves a variety of epistemic functions depending on the research at hand. Given such variation, I argue that the uncritical pursuit of reproducibility as an overarching epistemic value is misleading and potentially damaging to scientific advancement. Requirements for reproducibility, however they are interpreted, are one of many available means to securere liable research outcomes. Furthermore, there are cases wherethe focus on enhancing reproducibility turns out not to foster high-quality research. Scientific communities and Open Science advocates should learn from inferential reasoning from irreproducible data, and promoteincentives for all researchers to explicitly and publicly discuss (1) their methodological commitments, (2) the ways in which they learn from mistakes and problems in everyday practice, and (3) the strategies they use to choose which research component of any project needs to be preserved in the long term, and how.

  Reproducibility and repeatability dramatically increase the value of scientific experiments, but remain two challenging goals for the experimenters. Similar to the LAMP stack that considerably eased the web developers life, in this paper, we advocate the need of an analogous software stack to help the experimenters making reproducible research. We propose the EnosStack, an open source software stack especially designed for reproducible scientific experiments. EnosStack enables to easily describe experimental workflows meant to be re-used, while abstracting the underlying infrastructure running them. Being able to switch experiments from a local to a real testbed deployment greatly lower code development and validation time. We describe the abstractions that have driven its design, before presenting a real experiment we deployed on Grid'5000 to illustrate its usefulness. We also provide all the experiment code, data and results to the community.

  In recent years, evidence has emerged from disciplines ranging from biology to economics that many scientific studies are not reproducible. This evidence has led to declarations in both the scientific and lay press that science is experiencing a “reproducibility crisis” and that this crisis has significant impacts on both science and society, including misdirected effort, funding, and policy implemented on the basis of irreproducible research. In many cases, academic libraries are the natural organizations to lead efforts to implement recommendations from journals, funders, and societies to improve research reproducibility. In this editorial, we introduce the reproducibility crisis, define reproducibility and replicability, and then discusses how academic libraries can lead institutional support for reproducible research.

  Jeffrey Spies, Ph.D., is the Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of the non-profit Center for Open Science. In this presentation, Dr. Spies discusses motivations, values, and common experiences of researchers and scholars in research and publication processes. Spies explores biases toward confirmatory research to the exclusion of exploratory research, funding and reward incentives that conflict with scholarly values, and, costs of delayed research publication -- as measured in human lives. This critical approach to ethics and values in research and publication begs the questions “Where would we be if this [publishing] system were a little more reproducible, a little more efficient?” and asks for an examination of values as revealed by our practice; are we implying that some lives matter more than others? Spies discusses how open output [open access] and open workflow policies and practices assist scholars in aligning their scholarly practices more closely to their scholarly values.

  Reproducibility in experiments is necessary to verify claims and to reuse prior work in experiments that advance research. However, the traditional model of publication validates research claims through peer-review without taking reproducibility into account. Workflows encapsulate experiment descriptions and components and are suitable for representing reproducibility. Additionally, they can be published alongside traditional patterns as a form of documentation for the experiment which can be combined with linked open data. For reproducibility utilising published datasets, it is necessary to declare the conditions or restrictions for permissible reuse. In this paper, we take a look at the state of workflow reproducibility through a browser based tool and a corresponding study to identify how workflows might be combined with traditional forms of documentation and publication. We also discuss the licensing aspects for data in workflows and how it can be annotated using linked open data ontologies.

And in this case, Doucouliagos never meta-analyzed something he didn’t dislike. Of the fields covered in this corpus, half were statistically underpowered—the studies couldn’t show the effect they said they did. And most of the ones that were powerful enough overestimated the size of the effect they purported to show. Economics has a profound effect on policymaking and understanding human behavior. For a science, this is, frankly, dismal.

description: |
  Within the Open Science discussions, the current call for “reproducibility” comes from the raising awareness that results as presented in research papers are not as easily reproducible as expected, or even contradicted those original results in some reproduction efforts. In this context, transparency and openness are seen as key components to facilitate good scientific practices, as well as scientific discovery. As a result, many funding agencies now require the deposit of research data sets, institutions improve the training on the application of statistical methods, and journals begin to mandate a high level of detail on the methods and materials used. How can researchers be supported and encouraged to provide that level of transparency? An important component is the underlying research data, which is currently often only partly available within the article. At Elsevier we have therefore been working on journal data guidelines which clearly explain to researchers when and how they are expected to make their research data available. Simultaneously, we have also developed the corresponding infrastructure to make it as easy as possible for researchers to share their data in a way that is appropriate in their field. To ensure researchers get credit for the work they do on managing and sharing data, all our journals support data citation in line with the FORCE11 data citation principles – a key step in the direction of ensuring that we address the lack of credits and incentives which emerged from the Open Data analysis (Open Data - the Researcher Perspective https://www.elsevier.com/about/open-science/research-data/open-data-report ) recently carried out by Elsevier together with CWTS. Finally, the presentation will also touch upon a number of initiatives to ensure the reproducibility of software, protocols and methods. With STAR methods, for instance, methods are submitted in a Structured, Transparent, Accessible Reporting format; this approach promotes rigor and robustness, and makes reporting easier for the author and replication easier for the reader.

The analysis will be based on the LSA settings, measured parameters and real-time trims. The focus will be set on ramp and high energy reproducibility as they are more diflicult to assess and correct on a daily basis for certain parameters like chromaticity and coupling. The reproducibility of the machine in collision will be analysed in detail, in particular the beam offsets at the IPS since the ever decreasing beam sizes at the IPs make beam steering at the IP more and mode delicate.

We are not ourselves software engineers, database managers, or computer scientists, and we don’t presume to contribute anything to those disciplines. If this handbook accomplishes something, we hope it will be to help other social scientists realize that there are better ways to work. Much of the time, when you are solving problems with code and data, you are solving problems that have been solved before, better, and on a larger scale. Recognizing that will let you spend less time wrestling with your RA’s messy code, and more time on the research problems that got you interested in the first place.

  In January, Bruce Beutler, an immunologist at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, emailed Science editor-in-chief Jeremy Berg to report that attempts to replicate the findings in "MAVS, cGAS, and endogenous retroviruses in T-independent B cell responses" had weakened his confidence in original results. The paper had found that virus-like elements in the human genome play an important role in the immune system’s response to pathogens. Although Beutler and several co-authors requested retraction right off the bat, the journal discovered that two co-authors disagreed, which Berg told us drew out the retraction process. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the journal waited for Beutler’s lab to perform another replication attempt. Those findings were inconclusive and the dissenting authors continued to push back against retraction.

  In order for research methods to be consistent, accessible and reproducible, we need universal, widely understood standards for research that all scientists adhere to. NPL has been responsible for maintaining fundamental standards and units for more than 100 years and is now engaged in pioneering work to create a set of “gold standards” for all scientific methodologies, materials, analyses and protocols, based on exhaustive testing at a large number of laboratories, in tandem with both industry and national and international standardisation organisations.

  A survey on provenance: What for? What form? What from?

  Provenance refers to any information describing the production process of an end product, which can be anything from a piece of digital data to a physical object. While this survey focuses on the former type of end product, this definition still leaves room for many different interpretations of and approaches to provenance. These are typically motivated by different application domains for provenance (e.g., accountability, reproducibility, process debugging) and varying technical requirements such as runtime, scalability, or privacy. As a result, we observe a wide variety of provenance types and provenance-generating methods. This survey provides an overview of the research field of provenance, focusing on what provenance is used for (what for?), what types of provenance have been defined and captured for the different applications (what form?), and which resources and system requirements impact the choice of deploying a particular provenance solution (what from?). For each of these three key questions, we provide a classification and review the state of the art for each class. We conclude with a summary and possible future research challenges.

  Jug: Software for parallel reproducible computation in Python

date: 2017-10-21 00:00:00
tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  As computational pipelines become a bigger part of science, it is important to ensure that the results are reproducible, a concern which has come to the fore in recent years. All developed software should be able to be run automatically without any user intervention. In addition to being valuable to the wider community, which may wish to reproduce or extend a published analysis, reproducible research practices allow for better control over the project by the original authors themselves. For example, keeping a non-executable record of parameters and command line arguments leads to error-prone analysis and opens up the possibility that, when the results are to be written up for publication, the researcher will no longer be able to even completely describe the process that led to them. For large projects, the use of multiple computational cores (either in a multi-core machine or distributed across a compute cluster) is necessary to obtain results in a useful time frame. Furthermore, it is often the case that, as the project evolves, it becomes necessary to save intermediate results while down-stream analyses are designed (or redesigned) and implemented. Under many frameworks, this causes having a single point of entry for the computation becomes increasingly difficult. Jug is a software framework which addresses these issues by caching intermediate results  and distributing the computational work as tasks across a network. Jug is written in Python without the use of compiled modules, is completely crossplatform, and available as free software under the liberal MIT license.

  Utilising Semantic Web Ontologies To Publish Experimental Workflows

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  Reproducibility in experiments is necessary to verify claims and to reuse prior work in experiments that advance research. However,the traditional model of publication validates research claims through peer-review without taking reproducibility into account. Workflows encapsulate experiment descriptions and components and are suitable for representing reproducibility. Additionally, they can be published alongside traditional patterns as a form of documentation for the experiment which can be combined with linked open data. For reproducibility utilising published datasets, it is necessary to declare the conditions or restrictions for permissible reuse. In this paper, we take a look at the state of workflow reproducibility through a browser based tool and a corresponding study to identify how workflows might be combined with traditional forms of documentation and publication. We also discuss the licensing aspects for data in workflows and how it can be annotated using linked open data ontologies

description: |
  This report describes perspectives from the Workshop on the Future of Research Curation and Research Reproducibility that was collaboratively sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) in November 2016. The workshop brought together stakeholders including researchers, funders, and notably, leading science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) publishers. The overarching objective was a deep dive into new kinds of research products and how the costs of creation and curation of these products can be sustainably borne by the agencies, publishers, and researcher communities that were represented by workshop participants. The purpose of this document is to describe the ideas that participants exchanged on approaches to increasing the value of all research by encouraging the archiving of reusable data sets, curating reusable software, and encouraging broader dialogue within and across disciplinary boundaries. How should the review and publication processes change to promote reproducibility? What kinds of objects should the curatorial process expand to embrace? What infrastructure is required to preserve the necessary range of objects associated with an experiment? Who will undertake this work? And who will pay for it? These are the questions the workshop was convened to address in presentations, panels, small working groups, and general discussion.

  Reproducibility, a cornerstone of research, requires defined data formats, which include the set-up and output of experiments. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a recommended standard of the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines. Despite the popularity of the RDML format for analysis of qPCR data, handling of RDML files is not yet widely supported in all PCR curve analysis softwares. Results: This study describes the open source RDML package for the statistical computing language R.RDML is compatible with RDML versions ≤ 1.2 and provides functionality to (i) import RDML data; (ii) extract sample information (e.g., targets, concentration); (iii) transform data to various formats of the R environment; (iv) generate human readable run summaries; and (v) to create RDML files from user data. In addition, RDML offers a graphical user interface to read, edit and create RDML files.

  To address this critical need, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation has awarded a grant to a coalition of groups representing the international Earth and space science community, convened by the American Geophysical Union (AGU), to develop standards that will connect researchers, publishers, and data repositories in the Earth and space sciences to enable FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data – a concept first developed by Force11.org – on a large scale. This will accelerate scientific discovery and enhance the integrity, transparency, and reproducibility of this data. The resulting set of best practices will include: metadata and identifier standards; data services; common taxonomies; landing pages at repositories to expose the metadata and standard repository information; standard data citation; and standard integration into editorial peer review workflows.

  We present a toolchain for computational research consisting of Sacred and two supporting tools. Sacred is an open source Python framework which aims to provide basic infrastructure for running computational experiments independent of the methods and libraries used. Instead, it focuses on solving universal everyday problems, such as managing configurations, reproducing results, and bookkeeping. Moreover, it provides an extensible basis for other tools, two of which we present here: Labwatch helps with tuning hyperparameters, and Sacredboard provides a web-dashboard for organizing and analyzing runs and results.

  The Recomputation Manifesto

description: |
  Replication of scientific experiments is critical to the advance of science. Unfortunately, the discipline of Computer Science has never treated replication seriously, even though computers are very good at doing the same thing over and over again. Not only are experiments rarely replicated, they are rarely even replicable in a meaningful way. Scientists are being encouraged to make their source code available, but this is only a small step. Even in the happy event that source code can be built and run successfully, running code is a long way away from being able to replicate the experiment that code was used for. I propose that the discipline of Computer Science must embrace replication of experiments as standard practice. I propose that the only credible technique to make experiments truly replicable is to provide copies of virtual machines in which the experiments are validated to run. I propose that tools and repositories should be made available to make this happen. I propose to be one of those who makes it happen.

  Using ReproZip for Reproducibility and Library Services

description: |
  Achieving research reproducibility is challenging in many ways: there are social and cultural obstacles as well as a constantly changing technical landscape that makes replicating and reproducing research difficult. Users face challenges in reproducing research across different operating systems, in using different versions of software across long projects and among collaborations, and in using publicly available work. The dependencies required to reproduce the computational environments in which research happens can be exceptionally hard to track – in many cases, these dependencies are hidden or nested too deeply to discover, and thus impossible to install on a new machine, which means adoption remains low. 
  In this paper, we present ReproZip, an open source tool to help overcome the technical difficulties involved in preserving and replicating research, applications, databases, software, and more. We examine the current use cases of ReproZip, ranging from digital humanities to machine learning. We also explore potential library use cases for ReproZip, particularly in digital libraries and archives, liaison librarianship, and other library services. We believe that libraries and archives can leverage ReproZip to deliver more robust reproducibility services, repository services, as well as enhanced discoverability and preservation of research materials, applications, software, and computational environments.

  Promoting transparency and reproducibility in Behavioral Neuroscience: Publishing replications, registered reports, and null results

description: |
  The editors of Behavioral Neuroscience have been discussing several recent developments in the landscape of scientific publishing. The discussion was prompted, in part, by reported issues of reproducibility and concerns about the integrity of the scientific literature. Although enhanced rigor and transparency in science are certainly important, a related issue is that increased competition and focus on novel findings has impeded the extent to which the scientific process is cumulative. We have decided to join the growing number of journals that are adopting new reviewing and publishing practices to address these problems. In addition to our standard research articles, we are pleased to announce 3 new categories of articles: replications, registered reports, and null results. In joining other journals in psychology and related fields to offer these publication types, we hope to promote higher standards of methodological rigor in our science. This will ensure that our discoveries are based on sound evidence and that they provide a durable foundation for future progress. (PsycINFO Database Record)

  Computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing, running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing results, however computational science lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true.  James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested, hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests

  A big part of this problem has to do with what’s been called a “reproducibility crisis” in science – many studies if run a second time don’t come up with the same results. Scientists are worried about this situation, and high-profile international research journals have raised the alarm, too, calling on researchers to put more effort into ensuring their results can be reproduced, rather than only striving for splashy, one-off outcomes. Concerns about irreproducible results in science resonate outside the ivory tower, as well, because a lot of this research translates into information that affects our everyday lives.

  Over the past few years, research reproducibility has been increasingly highlighted as a multifaceted challenge across many disciplines. There are socio-cultural obstacles as well as a constantly changing technical landscape that make replicating and reproducing research extremely difficult. Researchers face challenges in reproducing research across different operating systems and different versions of software, to name just a few of the many technical barriers. The prioritization of citation counts and journal prestige has undermined incentives to make research reproducible. While libraries have been building support around research data management and digital scholarship, reproducibility is an emerging area that has yet to be systematically addressed. To respond to this, New York University (NYU) created the position of Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility (RDM & R), a dual appointment between the Center for Data Science (CDS) and the Division of Libraries. This report will outline the role of the RDM & R librarian, paying close attention to the collaboration between the CDS and Libraries to bring reproducible research practices into the norm.

  The Reproducibility Of Research And The Misinterpretation Of P Values

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  We wish to answer this question: If you observe a "significant" P value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive? The weak evidence provided by P values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive rates. When you observe P = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3:1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value. And if you want to limit the false positive rate to 5%, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done. If you observe P = 0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100:1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive, But the false positive rate would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect was only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive rate of 5% you would need to observe P = 0.00045. It is recommended that P values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive rate. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive rate associated with the observed P value. And that the terms "significant" and "non-significant" should never be used. Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of P < 0.05 as "significant". This practice must account for a substantial part of the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. And this is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomisation and P-hacking. Science is endangered by statistical misunderstanding, and by university presidents and research funders who impose perverse incentives on scientists.

 A high-profile project aiming to test reproducibility in cancer biology has released a second batch of results, and this time the news is good: Most of the experiments from two key cancer papers could be repeated. The latest replication studies, which appear today in eLife, come on top of five published in January that delivered a mixed message about whether high-impact cancer research can be reproduced. Taken together, however, results from the completed studies are “encouraging,” says Sean Morrison of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, an eLife editor. Overall, he adds, independent labs have now “reproduced substantial aspects” of the original experiments in four of five replication efforts that have produced clear results.

  Reproducibility in Machine Learning-Based Studies: An Example of Text Mining

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  Reproducibility is an essential requirement for computational studies including those based on machine learning techniques. However, many machine learning studies are either not reproducible or are difficult to reproduce. In this paper, we consider what information about text mining studies is crucial to successful reproduction of such studies. We identify a set of factors that affect reproducibility based on our experience of attempting to reproduce six studies proposing text mining techniques for the automation of the citation screening stage in the systematic review process. Subsequently, the reproducibility of 30 studies was evaluated based on the presence or otherwise of information relating to the factors. While the studies provide useful reports of their results, they lack information on access to the dataset in the form and order as used in the original study (as against raw data), the software environment used, randomization control and the implementation of proposed techniques. In order to increase the chances of being reproduced, researchers should ensure that details about and/or access to information about these factors are provided in their reports.

  Research is an incremental, iterative process, with new results relying and building upon previous ones. Scientists need to find, retrieve, understand, and verify results in order to confidently extend them, even when the results are their own. We present the trackr framework for organizing, automatically annotating, discovering, and retrieving results. We identify sources of automatically extractable metadata for computational results, and we define an extensible system for organizing, annotating, and searching for results based on these and other metadata. We present an opensource implementation of these concepts for plots, computational artifacts, and woven dynamic reports generated in the R statistical computing language.

  Progress toward openness, transparency, and reproducibility in cognitive neuroscience

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  Accumulating evidence suggests that many findings in psychological science and cognitive neuroscience may prove difficult to reproduce; statistical power in brain imaging studies is low, and has not improved recently; software errors in common analysis tools are common, and can go undetected for many years; and, a few large scale studies notwithstanding, open sharing of data, code, and materials remains the rare exception. At the same time, there is a renewed focus on reproducibility, transparency, and openness as essential core values in cognitive neuroscience. The emergence and rapid growth of data archives, meta-analytic tools, software pipelines, and research groups devoted to improved methodology reflects this new sensibility. We review evidence that the field has begun to embrace new open research practices, and illustrate how these can begin to address problems of reproducibility, statistical power, and transparency in ways that will ultimately accelerate discovery.

link: https://osf.io/4np66/
date: 2017-04-20 00:00:00
tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  Background: The reproducibility of research is essential to rigorous science, yet significant concerns of the reliability and verifiability of biomedical research have been recently highlighted. Ongoing efforts across several domains of science and policy are working to clarify the fundamental characteristics of reproducibility and to enhance the transparency and accessibility of research. 
  Methods: The aim of the proceeding work is to develop an assessment tool operationalizing key concepts of research transparency in the biomedical domain, specifically for secondary biomedical data research using electronic health record data. The tool (RepeAT) was developed through a multi-phase process that involved coding and extracting recommendations and practices for improving reproducibility from publications and reports across the biomedical and statistical sciences, field testing the instrument, and refining variables. 
  Results: RepeAT includes 103 unique variables grouped into five categories (research design and aim, database and data collection methods, data mining and data cleaning, data analysis, data sharing and documentation). Preliminary results in manually processing 40 scientific manuscripts indicate components of the proposed framework with strong inter-rater reliability, as well as directions for further research and refinement of RepeAT. 
  Conclusions: The use of RepeAT may allow the biomedical community to have a better understanding of the current practices of research transparency and accessibility among principal investigators. Common adoption of RepeAT may improve reporting of research practices and the availability of research outputs. Additionally, use of RepeAT will facilitate comparisons of research transparency and accessibility across domains and institutions.

  Amidst the recent flood of concerns about transparency and reproducibility in the behavioral and clinical sciences, we suggest a simple, inexpensive, easy-to-implement, and uniquely powerful tool to improve the reproducibility of scientific research and accelerate progress—video recordings of experimental procedures. Widespread use of video for documenting procedures could make moot disagreements about whether empirical replications truly reproduced the original experimental conditions. We call on researchers, funders, and journals to make commonplace the collection and open sharing of video-recorded procedures.

  Do researchers need a new "Craigslist?" We were recently alerted to a new online platform called StudySwap by one of its creators, who said it was partially inspired by one of our posts. The platform creates an "online marketplace" that previous researchers have called for, connecting scientists with willing partners – such as a team looking for someone to replicate its results, and vice versa. As co-creators Christopher Chartier at Ashland University and Randy McCarthy at Northern Illinois University tell us, having a place where researchers can find each other more efficiently "is in everyone’s best interest."

  Ethical and legal implications of the methodological crisis in neuroimaging

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  Currently, many scientific fields such as psychology or biomedicine face a methodological crisis concerning the reproducibility, replicability and validity of their research. In neuroimaging, similar methodological concerns have taken hold of the field and researchers are working frantically towards finding solutions for the methodological problems specific to neuroimaging. This paper examines some ethical and legal implications of this methodological crisis in neuroimaging. With respect to ethical challenges, the paper discusses the impact of flawed methods in neuroimaging research in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, particulyrly with respect to faulty brain-based models of human cognition, behavior and personality. Specifically examined is whether such faulty models, when they are applied to neurological or psychiatric diseases, could put patients at risk and whether this places special obligations upon researchers using neuroimaging. In the legal domain, the actual use of neuroimaging as evidence in U.S. courtrooms is surveyed, followed by an examination of ways the methodological problems may create challenges for the criminal justice system. Finally, the paper reviews and promotes some promising ideas and initiatives from within the neuroimaging community for addressing the methodological problems.

  While linguists have always relied on language data, they have not always facilitated access to those data. Linguistic publications typically include short excerpts from data sets, ordinarily consisting of fewer than five words, and often without citation. Where citations are provided, the connection to the data set is usually only vaguely identified. An excerpt might be given a citation which refers to the name of the text from which it was extracted, but in practice the reader has no way to access that text. That is, in spite of the potential generated by recent shifts in the field, a great deal of linguistic research created today is not reproducible, either in principle or in practice. The workshops and panel presentation will facilitate development of standards for the curation and citation of linguistics data that are responsive to these changing conditions and shift the field of linguistics toward a more scientific, data-driven model which results in reproducible research.

  Data are fundamental to the field of linguistics. Examples drawn from natural languages provide a foundation for claims about the nature of human language, and validation of these linguistic claims relies crucially on these supporting data. Yet, while linguists have always relied on language data, they have not always facilitated access to those data. Publications typically include only short excerpts from data sets, and where citations are provided, the connections to the data sets are usually only vaguely identified. At the same time, the field of linguistics has generally viewed the value of data without accompanying analysis with some degree of skepticism, and thus linguists have murky benchmarks for evaluating the creation, curation, and sharing of data sets in hiring, tenure and promotion decisions.This disconnect between linguistics publications and their supporting data results in much linguistic research being unreproducible, either in principle or in practice. Without reproducibility, linguistic claims cannot be readily validated or tested, rendering their scientific value moot. In order to facilitate the development of reproducible research in linguistics, The Linguistics Data Interest Group plans to develop the discipline-wide adoption of common standards for data citation and attribution. In our parlance citation refers to the practice of identifying the source of linguistic data, and attribution refers to mechanisms for assessing the intellectual and academic value of data citations.

  Reproducible research in the Python ecosystem: a reality check

  In summary, my little experiment has shown that reproducibility of Python scripts requires preserving the original environment, which fortunately is not so difficult over a time span of four years, at least if everything you need is part of the Anaconda distribution. I am not sure I would have had the patience to reinstall everything from source, given an earlier bad experience. The purely computational part of my code was even surprisingly robust under updates in its dependencies. But the plotting code wasn’t, as matplotlib has introduced backwards-incompatible changes in a widely used function. Clearly the matplotlib team prepared this carefully, introducing a deprecation warning before introducing the breaking change. For properly maintained client code, this can probably be dealt with.

  Structuring supplemental materials in support of reproducibility

  Supplements are increasingly important to the scientific record, particularly in genomics. However, they are often underutilized. Optimally, supplements should make results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., “FAIR”). Moreover, properly off-loading to them the data and detail in a paper could make the main text more readable. We propose a hierarchical organization for supplements, with some parts paralleling and “shadowing” the main text and other elements branching off from it, and we suggest a specific formatting to make this structure explicit. Furthermore, sections of the supplement could be presented in multiple scientific “dialects”, including machine-readable and lay-friendly formats.

  The reproducibility of scientific experiments is crucial for corroborating, consolidating and reusing new scientific discoveries. However, the constant pressure for publishing results (Fanelli, 2010) has removed reproducibility from the agenda of many researchers: in a recent survey published in Nature (with more than 1500 scientists) over 70% of the participants recognize to have failed to reproduce the work from another colleague at some point in time (Baker, 2016). Analyses from psychology and cancer biology show reproducibility rates below 40% and 10% respectively (Collaboration, 2015) (Begley & Lee, 2012). As a consequence, retractions of publications have occurred in the last years in several disciplines (Marcus & Oransky, 2014) (Rockoff, 2015), and the general public is now skeptical about scientific studies on topics like pesticides, depression drugs or flu pandemics (American, 2010).

  There is a "village" of people impacting research reproducibility, such as funding panels, the IACUC and its support staff, institutional leaders, investigators, veterinarians, animal facilities, and professional journals. IACUCs can contribute to research reproducibility by ensuring that reviews of animal use requests, program self-assessments and post-approval monitoring programs are sufficiently thorough, the animal model is appropriate for testing the hypothesis, animal care and use is conducted in a manner that is compliant with external and institutional requirements, and extraneous variables are minimized. The persons comprising the village also must have a shared vision that guards against reproducibility problems while simultaneously avoids being viewed as a burden to research. This review analyzes and discusses aspects of the IACUC's "must do" and "can do" activities that impact the ability of a study to be reproduced. We believe that the IACUC, with support from and when working synergistically with other entities in the village, can contribute to minimizing unintended research variables and strengthen research reproducibility.

  Reproducible research is a key element of the scientific process. Re-executability of neuroimaging workflows that lead to the conclusions arrived at in the literature has not yet been sufficiently addressed and adopted by the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we document a set of procedures, which include supplemental additions to a manuscript, that unambiguously define the data, workflow, execution environment and results of a neuroimaging analysis, in order to generate a verifiable re-executable publication. Re-executability provides a starting point for examination of the generalizability and reproducibility of a given finding.

  Replication, validation and extension of experiments are crucial for scientific progress. Computational experiments are scriptable and should be easy to reproduce. However, computational analyses are designed and run in a specific computing environment, which may be difficult or impossible to match using written instructions. We report the development of continuous analysis, a workflow that enables reproducible computational analyses. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container technology akin to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a software development technique, to automatically rerun a computational analysis whenever updates or improvements are made to source code or data. This enables researchers to reproduce results without contacting the study authors. Continuous analysis allows reviewers, editors or readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning code and can provide an audit trail for analyses of data that cannot be shared.

  Recent studies have demonstrated the difficulties to replicate scientific findings and/or experiments published in past.1 The effects seen in the replicated experiments were smaller than previously reported. Some of the explanations for these findings include the complexity of the experimental design and the pressure on researches to report positive findings. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) suggests that every study considered for publication must submit a plan to share the de-identified patient data no later than 6 months after publication. There is a growing demand to enhance the management of clinical data, facilitate data sharing across institutions and also to keep track of the data from previous experiments. The ultimate goal is to assure the reproducibility of experiments in the future. This paper describes Shiny-tooth, a web based application created to improve clinical data acquisition during the clinical trial; data federation of such data as well as morphological data derived from medical images; Currently, this application is being used to store clinical data from an osteoarthritis (OA) study. This work is submitted to the SPIE Biomedical Applications in Molecular, Structural, and Functional Imaging conference.

  Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) mostly uses proprietary software,but the interest in Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) for GEOBIA is growing. This interest stems not only from cost savings, but also from benefits concerning reproducibility and collaboration. Technical challenges hamper practical reproducibility, especially when multiple software packages are required to conduct an analysis. In this study, we use containerization to package a GEOBIA workflow in a well-defined FOSS environment. We explore the approach using two software stacks to perform an exemplary analysis detecting destruction of buildings in bi-temporal images of a conflict area. The analysis combines feature extraction techniques with segmentation and object-based analysis to detect changes using automatically-defined local reference values and to distinguish disappeared buildings from non-target structures. The resulting workflow is published as FOSS comprising both the model and data in a ready to use Docker image and a user interface for interaction with the containerized workflow. The presented solution advances GEOBIA in the following aspects: higher transparency of methodology; easier reuse and adaption of workflows; better transferability between operating systems; complete description of the software environment; and easy application of workflows by image analysis experts and non-experts. As a result, it promotes not only the reproducibility of GEOBIA, but also its practical adoption.

  According to a recent survey conducted by the journal Nature, a large percentage of scientists agrees we live in times of irreproducibility of research results [1]. They believe that much of what is published just cannot be trusted. While the results of the survey may be biased toward respondents with interest in the area of reproducibility, a concern is recognizable. Goodman et al. discriminate between different aspects of reproducibility and dissect the term into ‘material reproducibility’ (provision of sufficient information to enable repetition of the procedures), ‘results reproducibility’ (obtaining the same results from an independent study; formerly termed ‘replicability’) and ‘inferential reproducibility’ (drawing the same conclusions from separate studies) [2]. The validity of data is threatened by many issues, among others by poor utility of public information, poor protocols and design, lack of standard analytical, clinical practices and knowledge, conflict of interest and other biases, as well as publication strategy.

  Reproducibility is the idea that an experiment can be repeated by another scientist and they will get the same result. It is important to show that the claims of any experiment are true and for them to be useful for any further research. However, science appears to have an issue with reproducibility. A survey by Nature revealed that 52% of researchers believed there was a "significant reproducibility crisis" and 38% said there was a "slight crisis". We asked three experts how they think the situation could be improved.

  There is growing interest in enhancing research transparency and reproducibility in economics and other scientific fields. We survey existing work on these topics within economics, and discuss the evidence suggesting that publication bias, inability to replicate, and specification searching remain widespread in the discipline. We next discuss recent progress in this area, including through improved research design, study registration and pre-analysis plans, disclosure standards, and open sharing of data and materials, drawing on experiences in both economics and other social sciences. We discuss areas where consensus is emerging on new practices, as well as approaches that remain controversial, and speculate about the most effective ways to make economics research more credible in the future.

 Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. In 2016 the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network published a study of adolescent brain development which showed that the hubs of the structural connectome are late developing and are found in association cortex (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601745113). Furthermore these regions are enriched for genes related to schizophrenia. In this presentation Dr Kirstie Whitaker will demonstrate how this work is supported by open data and analysis code, and that the results replicate in two independent cohorts of teenagers. She will encourage Brainhack-Global participants to take steps towards ensuring that their work meets these standards for open and reproducible science in 2017 and beyond.

  Many journal editors are a failing to implement their own authors’ instructions, resulting in the publication of many articles that do not meet basic standards of transparency, employ unsuitable data analysis methods and report overly optimistic conclusions. This problem is particularly acute where quantitative measurements are made and results in the publication of papers that lack scientific rigor and contributes to the concerns with regard to the reproducibility of biomedical research. This hampers research areas such as biomarker identification, as reproducing all but the most striking changes is challenging and translation to patient care rare.

Most of these files are images that should be downloaded and organized in the same location as the source .Rnw file. A few files contain data that have already been processed (and could be independently re-created using code in the .Rnw file) - these are included to shorten the processing time needed to reproduce the original document. The raw data files for most of the analyses are stored in 3 separate locations, 1 for each of the 3 samples.

  According to Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and one of the authors of the Mayo Clinic Proceedings paper, medicine is quick to adopt practices based on shaky evidence but slow to drop them once they’ve been blown up by solid proof. As a young doctor, Prasad had an experience that left him determined to banish ineffective procedures. He was the medical resident on a team caring for a middle-aged woman with stable chest pain. She underwent a stent procedure and suffered a stroke, resulting in brain damage. Prasad, now at the Oregon Health and Sciences University, still winces slightly when he talks about it. University of Chicago professor and physician Adam Cifu had a similar experience. Cifu had spent several years convincing newly postmenopausal patients to go on hormone therapy for heart health—a treatment that at the millennium accounted for 90 million annual prescriptions—only to then see a well-designed trial show no heart benefit and perhaps even a risk of harm. "I had to basically run back all those decisions with women," he says. "And, boy, that really sticks with you, when you have patients saying, 'But I thought you said this was the right thing.'" So he and Prasad coauthored a 2015 book, Ending Medical Reversal, a call to raise the evidence bar for adopting new medical standards. "We have a culture where we reward discovery; we don’t reward replication," Prasad says, referring to the process of retesting initial scientific findings to make sure they’re valid.

  As a principal investigator, how do you run your lab for reproducibility? I submit the following action areas: commitment, transparency and open science, onboarding, collaboration, community and leadership. Make a public commitment to reproducible research—what this means for you could differ from others, but an essential core is common to all. Transparency is an essential value, and embracing open science is the best route to realize it. Onboarding every lab member with a deliberate group “syllabus” for reproducibility sets the expectations high. What is your list of must-read literature on reproducible research? I can share mine with you: my lab members helped to make it. For collaborating efficiently and building community, we take inspiration from the open-source world. We adopt its technology platforms to work on software and to communicate, openly and collaboratively. Key to the open-source culture is to give credit—give lots of credit for every contribution: code, documentation, tests, issue reports! The tools and methods require training, but running a lab for reproducibility is your decision. Start here–>commitment.

  Reproducibility is an important part of scientific research and studies published in speech and language research usually make some attempt at ensuring that the work reported could be reproduced by other researchers. This paper looks at the current practice in the field relating to the citation and availability of both data and software methods. It is common to use widely available shared datasets in this field which helps to ensure that studies can be reproduced; however a brief survey of recent papers shows a wide range of styles of citation of data only some of which clearly identify the exact data used in the study. Similarly, practices in describing and sharing software artefacts vary considerably from detailed descriptions of algorithms to linked repositories. The Alveo Virtual Laboratory is a web based platform to support research based on collections of text, speech and video. Alveo provides a central repository for language data and provides a set of services for discovery and analysis of data. We argue that some of the features of the Alveo platform may make it easier for researchers to share their data more precisely and cite the exact software tools used to develop published results. Alveo makes use of ideas developed in other areas of science and we discuss these and how they can be applied to speech and language research.

  Using Docker Containers to Extend Reproducibility Architecture for the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX)

  NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) is a data, supercomputing and knowledge collaboratory that houses NASA satellite, climate and ancillary data where a focused community can come together to address large-scale challenges in Earth sciences. As NEX has been growing into a petabyte-size platform for analysis, experiments and data production, it has been increasingly important to enable users to easily retrace their steps, identify what datasets were produced by which process chains, and give them ability to readily reproduce their results. This can be a tedious and difficult task even for a small project, but is almost impossible on large processing pipelines. We have developed an initial reproducibility and knowledge capture solution for the NEX, however, if users want to move the code to another system, whether it is their home institution cluster, laptop or the cloud, they have to find, build and install all the required dependencies that would run their code. This can be a very tedious and tricky process and is a big impediment to moving code to data and reproducibility outside the original system. The NEX team has tried to assist users who wanted to move their code into OpenNEX on Amazon cloud by creating custom virtual machines with all the software and dependencies installed, but this, while solving some of the issues, creates a new bottleneck that requires the NEX team to be involved with any new request, updates to virtual machines and general maintenance support. In this presentation, we will describe a solution that integrates NEX and Docker to bridge the gap in code-to-data migration. The core of the solution is saemi-automatic conversion of science codes, tools and services that are already tracked and described in the NEX provenance system, to Docker - an open-source Linux container software. Docker is available on most computer platforms, easy to install and capable of seamlessly creating and/or executing any application packaged in the appropriate format. We believe this is an important step towards seamless process deployment in heterogeneous environments that will enhance community access to NASA data and tools in a scalable way, promote software reuse, and improve reproducibility of scientific results.

  Computational workflows consist of a series of steps in which data is generated, manipulated, analysed and transformed. Researchers use tools and techniques to capture the provenance associated with the data to aid reproducibility. The metadata collected not only helps in reproducing the computation but also aids in comparing the original and reproduced computations. In this paper, we present an approach, "Why-Diff", to analyse the difference between two related computations by changing the artifacts and how the existing tools "YesWorkflow" and "NoWorkflow" record the changed artifacts.

  Born-digital news content is increasingly becoming the format of the first draft of history. Archiving and preserving this history is of paramount importance to the future of scholarly research, but many technical, legal, financial, and logistical challenges stand in the way of these efforts. This is especially true for news applications, or custom-built websites that comprise some of the most sophisticated journalism stories today, such as the “Dollars for Docs” project by ProPublica. Many news applications are standalone pieces of software that query a database, and this significant subset of apps cannot be archived in the same way as text-based news stories, or fully captured by web archiving tools such as Archive-It. As such, they are currently disappearing. This paper will outline the various challenges facing the archiving and preservation of born-digital news applications, as well as outline suggestions for how to approach this important work.

  Computational Analysis of Lifespan Experiment Reproducibility

description: |
  Independent reproducibility is essential to the generation of scientific knowledge. Optimizing experimental protocols to ensure reproducibility is an important aspect of scientific work. Genetic or pharmacological lifespan extensions are generally small compared to the inherent variability in mean lifespan even in isogenic populations housed under identical conditions. This variability makes reproducible detection of small but real effects experimentally challenging. In this study, we aimed to determine the reproducibility of C. elegans lifespan measurements under ideal conditions, in the absence of methodological errors or environmental or genetic background influences. To accomplish this, we generated a parametric model of C. elegans lifespan based on data collected from 5,026 wild-type N2 animals. We use this model to predict how different experimental practices, effect sizes, number of animals, and how different ‘shapes’ of survival curves affect the ability to reproduce real longevity effects. We find that the chances of reproducing real but small effects are exceedingly low and would require substantially more animals than are commonly used. Our results indicate that many lifespan studies are underpowered to detect reported changes and that, as a consequence, stochastic variation alone can account for many failures to reproduce longevity results. As a remedy, we provide power of detection tables that can be used as guidelines to plan experiments with statistical power to reliably detect real changes in lifespan and limit spurious false positive results. These considerations will improve best-practices in designing lifespan experiment to increase reproducibility.

description: |
  Reproducibility has become one of biology’s most pressing issues. This impasse has been fueled by the combined reliance on increasingly complex data analysis methods and the exponential growth of biological datasets. When considering the installation, deployment and maintenance of bioinformatic pipelines, an even more challenging picture emerges due to the lack of community standards. The effect of limited standards on reproducibility is amplified by the very diverse range of computational platforms and configurations on which these applications are expected to be applied (workstations, clusters, HPC, clouds, etc.). With no established standard at any level, diversity cannot be taken for granted.

  The concept of reproducibility is one of the foundations of scientific practice and the bedrock by which scientific validity can be established. However, the extent to which reproducibility is being achieved in the sciences is currently under question. Several studies have shown that much peer-reviewed scientific literature is not reproducible. One crucial contributor to the obstruction of reproducibility is the lack of transparency of original data and methods. Reproducibility, the ability of scientific results and conclusions to be independently replicated by independent parties, potentially using different tools and approaches, can only be achieved if data and methods are fully disclosed.

  The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the richness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.

  Take the latest findings from the large-scale Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology. Here, researchers focused on reproducing experiments from the highest-impact papers about cancer biology published from 2010 to 2012. They shared their results in five papers in the journal ELife last week — and not one of their replications definitively confirmed the original results. The findings echoed those of another landmark reproducibility project, which, like the cancer biology project, came from the Center for Open Science. This time, the researchers replicated major psychology studies — and only 36 percent of them confirmed the original conclusions.

  Since 2005, when Stanford University professor John Ioannidis published his paper “Why Most Published Findings Are False” in PLOS Medicine, reports have been mounting of studies that are false, misleading, and/or irreproducible. Two major pharmaceutical companies each took a sample of “landmark” cancer biology papers and only were able to validate the findings of 6% and 11%, respectively. A similar attempt to validate 70 potential drugs targets for treating amytrophic lateral sclerosis in mice came up with zero positive results. In psychology, an effort to replicate 100 peer-reviewed studies successfully reproduced the results for only 39. While most replication efforts have focused on biomedicine, health, and psychology, a recent survey of over 1,500 scientists from various fields suggests that the problem is widespread. What originally began as a rumor among scientists has become a heated debate garnering national attention. The assertion that many published scientific studies cannot be reproduced has been covered in nearly every major newspaper, featured in TED talks, and discussed on televised late night talk shows.

  A large portion of scientific results is based on analysing and processing research data. In order for an eScience experiment to be reproducible, we need to able to identify precisely the data set which was used in a study. Considering evolving data sources this can be a challenge, as studies often use subsets which have been extracted from a potentially large parent data set. Exporting and storing subsets in multiple versions does not scale with large amounts of data sets. For tackling this challenge, the RDA Working Group on Data Citation has developed a framework and provides a set of recommendations, which allow identifying precise subsets of evolving data sources based on versioned data and timestamped queries. In this work, we describe how this method can be applied in small scale research data scenarios and how it can be implemented in large scale data facilities having access to sophisticated data infrastructure. We describe how the RDA approach improves the reproducibility of eScience experiments and we provide an overview of existing pilots and use cases in small and large scale settings.

  This project considers the role of reproducibility in increasing verification and accountability in linguistic research. An analysis of over 370 journal articles, dissertations, and grammars from a ten-year span is taken as a sample of current practices in the field. These are critiqued on the basis of transparency of data source, data collection methods, analysis, and storage. While we find examples of transparent reporting, much of the surveyed research does not include key metadata, methodological information, or citations that are resolvable to the data on which the analyses are based. This has implications for reproducibility and hence accountability, hallmarks of social science research which are currently under-represented in linguistic research.

  A strong movement towards openness has seized science. Open data and methods, open source software, Open Access, open reviews, and open research platforms provide the legal and technical solutions to new forms of research and publishing. However, publishing reproducible research is still not common practice. Reasons include a lack of incentives and a missing standardized infrastructure for providing research material such as data sets and source code together with a scientific paper. Therefore we first study fundamentals and existing approaches. On that basis, our key contributions are the identification of core requirements of authors, readers, publishers, curators, as well as preservationists and the subsequent description of an executable research compendium (ERC). It is the main component of a publication process providing a new way to publish and access computational research. ERCs provide a new standardisable packaging mechanism which combines data, software, text, and a user interface description. We discuss the potential of ERCs and their challenges in the context of user requirements and the established publication processes. We conclude that ERCs provide a novel potential to find, explore, reuse, and archive computer-based research.

  Scientific research is published in journals so that the research community is able to share knowledge and results, verify hypotheses, contribute evidence-based opinions and promote discussion. However, it is hard to fully understand, let alone reproduce, the results if the complex data manipulation that was undertaken to obtain the results are not clearly explained and/or the final data used is not available. Furthermore, the scale of research data assets has now exponentially increased to the point that even when available, it can be difficult to store and use these data assets. In this paper, we describe the solution we have implemented at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) whereby researchers can capture workflows, using a standards-based provenance representation. This provenance information, combined with access to the original dataset and other related information systems, allow datasets to be regenerated as needed which simultaneously addresses both result reproducibility and storage issues.

  Improving the reliability and efficiency of scientific research will increase the credibility of the published scientific literature and accelerate discovery. Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.

  Somewhere between 65 and 90 per cent of biomedical literature is considered non-reproducible. This means that if you try to reproduce an experiment described in a given paper, 65 to 90 per cent of the time you won't get the same findings. We call this the reproducibility crisis. The issue became live thanks to a study by Glenn Begley, who ran the oncology department at Amgen, a pharmaceutical company. In 2011, Begley decided to try to reproduce findings in 53 foundational papers in oncology: highly cited papers published in the top journals. He was unable to reproduce 47 of them - 89 per cent.

We next discuss recent progress in this area, including through improved research design, study registration and pre-analysis plans, disclosure standards, and open sharing of data and materials, drawing on experiences in both economics and other social sciences. We discuss areas where consensus is emerging on new practices, as well as approaches that remain controversial, and speculate about the most effective ways to make economics research more credible in the future.

Based on discussions in a recent Dagstuhl seminar we will identify different types of reproducibility. Here, we will focus specifically on what we gain from them, rather than seeing them merely as means to an end. We subsequently will address two core challenges impacting reproducibility, namely (1) understanding and automatically capturing process context and provenance information, and (2) approaches allowing us to deal with dynamically evolving data sets relying on recommendation of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). The goal is to raise awareness of reproducibility challenges and show ways how these can be addressed with minimal impact on the researchers via research infrastructures offering according services.

  A team of scientists including Stanford’s John Ioannidis, MD, DSc, has proposed a set of principles to improve the transparency and reproducibility of computational methods used in all areas of research. The group’s summary of those principles, known as the Reproducibility Enhancement Principles, was published recently in a paper in Science.

  Over the past two decades, computational methods have radically changed the ability of researchers from all areas of scholarship to process and analyze data and to simulate complex systems. But with these advances come challenges that are contributing to broader concerns over irreproducibility in the scholarly literature, among them the lack of transparency in disclosure of computational methods. Current reporting methods are often uneven, incomplete, and still evolving. We present a novel set of Reproducibility Enhancement Principles (REP) targeting disclosure challenges involving computation. These recommendations, which build upon more general proposals from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (1) and recommendations for field data (2), emerged from workshop discussions among funding agencies, publishers and journal editors, industry participants, and researchers representing a broad range of domains. Although some of these actions may be aspirational, we believe it is important to recognize and move toward ameliorating irreproducibility in computational research.

  Scientists propose a modified critical incident reporting system to help combat the reproducibility crisis.When Dirnagl first considered that his lab might benefit from a formal incident reporting system, he was surprised to find that no such system existed for biomedical researchers. Other high-stakes fields, from clinical medicine to nuclear power research, have long had such systems in place, but for the preclinical space, "we had to create one, because there’s nothing like it," Dirnagl said. But once Dirnagl and colleagues introduced an anonymous, online system, people began submitting reports. At meetings, the team would discuss what had gone wrong and strategize how to fix it. After a short while, Dirnagl said, his team began voluntarily filing virtually all reports with their signatures on them.

  The Researchers’ View of Scientific Rigor—Survey on the Conduct and Reporting of In Vivo Research

date: 2016-12-02 00:00:00
tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  Reproducibility in animal research is alarmingly low, and a lack of scientific rigor has been proposed as a major cause. Systematic reviews found low reporting rates of measures against risks of bias (e.g., randomization, blinding), and a correlation between low reporting rates and overstated treatment effects. Reporting rates of measures against bias are thus used as a proxy measure for scientific rigor, and reporting guidelines (e.g., ARRIVE) have become a major weapon in the fight against risks of bias in animal research. Surprisingly, animal scientists have never been asked about their use of measures against risks of bias and how they report these in publications. Whether poor reporting reflects poor use of such measures, and whether reporting guidelines may effectively reduce risks of bias has therefore remained elusive. To address these questions, we asked in vivo researchers about their use and reporting of measures against risks of bias and examined how self-reports relate to reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. An online survey was sent out to all registered in vivo researchers in Switzerland (N = 1891) and was complemented by personal interviews with five representative in vivo researchers to facilitate interpretation of the survey results. Return rate was 28% (N = 530), of which 302 participants (16%) returned fully completed questionnaires that were used for further analysis.

  Accumulating evidence indicates high risk of bias in preclinical animal research, questioning the scientific validity and reproducibility of published research findings. Systematic reviews found low rates of reporting of measures against risks of bias in the published literature (e.g., randomization, blinding, sample size calculation) and a correlation between low reporting rates and inflated treatment effects. That most animal research undergoes peer review or ethical review would offer the possibility to detect risks of bias at an earlier stage, before the research has been conducted.

  It’s not a new story, although "the reproducibility crisis" may seem to be. For life sciences, I think it started in the late 1950s. Problems caused in clinical research burst into the open in a very public way then. But before we get to that, what is "research reproducibility"? It’s a euphemism for unreliable research or research reporting. Steve Goodman and colleagues (2016) say 3 dimensions of science that affect reliability are at play: Methods reproducibility – enough detail available to enable a study to be repeated; Results reproducibility – the findings are replicated by others; Inferential reproducibility – similar conclusions are drawn about results, which brings statistics and interpretation squarely into the mix. There is a lot of history behind each of those. Here are some of the milestones in awareness and proposed solutions that stick out for me.

  Replicability is a core principle of the scientific method. However, several scientific disciplines have suffered crises in confidence caused, in large part, by attitudes toward replication. This work reports on the value the computing education research community associates with studies that aim to replicate, reproduce or repeat earlier research. The results were obtained from a survey of 73 computing education researchers. An analysis of the responses confirms that researchers in our field hold many of the same biases as those in other fields experiencing a crisis in replication. In particular, researchers agree that original works - novel works that report new phenomena - have more impact and are more prestigious. They also agree that originality is an important criteria for accepting a paper, making such work more likely to be published. Furthermore, while the respondents agree that published work should be verifiable, they doubt this standard is widely met in the computing education field and are not eager to perform the work of verifying others' work themselves.

  One of the most valuable talks of the day for me was from Fernando Chirigati from New York University. He introduced us to a useful new tool called ReproZip. He made the point that the computational environment is as important as the data itself for the reproducibility of research data. This could include information about libraries used, environment variables and options. You can not expect your depositors to find or document all of the dependencies (or your future users to install them). What ReproZip does is package up all the necessary dependencies along with the data itself. This package can then be archived and re-used in the future. ReproZip can also be used to unpack and re-use the data in the future. I can see a very real use case for this for researchers within our institution.

  The advent of the internet has meant that scholarly communication has changed immeasurably over the past two decades but in some ways it has hardly changed at all. The coin in the realm of any research remains the publication of novel results in a high impact journal – despite known issues with the Journal Impact Factor. This elusive goal has led to many problems in the research process: from hyperauthorship to high levels of retractions, reproducibility problems and 'cherry picking' of results. The veracity of the academic record is increasingly being brought into question. An additional problem is this static reward systems binds us to the current publishing regime, preventing any real progress in terms of widespread open access or even adoption of novel publishing opportunities. But there is a possible solution. Increased calls to open research up and provide a greater level of transparency have started to yield practical real solutions. This talk will cover the problems we currently face and describe some of the innovations that might offer a way forward.

  "Open access" has become a central theme of journal reform inacademic publishing. In this article, Iexamine the consequences of an important technological loophole in which publishers can claim to be adhering to the principles of open access by releasing articles in proprietary or “locked” formats that cannot be processed by automated tools, whereby even simple copy and pasting of text is disabled. These restrictions will prevent the development of an important infrastructural element of a modern research enterprise, namely,scientific data science, or the use of data analytic techniques to conduct meta-analyses and investigations into the scientific corpus. I give a brief history of the open access movement, discuss novel journalistic practices, and an overview of data-driven investigation of the scientific corpus. I arguethat particularly in an era where the veracity of many research studies has been called into question, scientific data science should be oneof the key motivations for open access publishing. The enormous benefits of unrestricted access to the research literature should prompt scholars from all disciplines to reject publishing models whereby articles are released in proprietary formats or are otherwise restricted from being processed by automated tools as part of a data science pipeline.

  Reproducibility is a hallmark of scientific efforts. Estimates indicate that lack of reproducibility of data ranges from 50% to 90% among published research reports. The inability to reproduce major findings of published data confounds  new discoveries, and importantly, result in wastage of limited resources in the futile effort to build on these published reports. This poses a challenge to the research community to change the way we approach reproducibility by developing new tools to help progress the reliability of methods and materials we use in our trade.

Our approach has two nested goals: 1) deliver an environment that enables researchers to create a  complete  narrative  of  the  research process including exposure of the data-to-publication lifecycle, and 2)  systematically and persistently link research publications to their associated digital scholarly objects such as the data,  code, and workflows. To enable this, WholeTale will create an environment where researchers can collaborate on data,  workspaces, and workflows and then publish them for future adoption or modification. Published data and applications will  be consumed either directly by users using the Whole Tale environment or can be integrated into existing or future  domain  Science Gateways.

  The way science journals present research must be rehabilitated or risk becoming obsolete, causing foreseeable negative consequences to research funding and pro-ductivity.  Researchers are dealing with ever- increasing complexities, and as techniques and solutions become more involved, so too does the task of describing them.  Unfortunately, simply explaining a technique with text does not always paint a clear enough picture. Scientific publishing has followed essentially the same model since the original scientific journal was published in the mid-seventeenth century. Thanks to advances in technology, we have seen some minor improvements such as the addition of color printing and better dissemination and search functionality through online cataloging.  But what has actually changed?  In truth, not all that much. Articles are still published as text heavy-tomes with the occasional pho-tograph or chart to demonstrate a point.

  Workflow is a well-established means by which to capture scientific methods in an abstract graph of interrelated processing tasks. The reproducibility of scientific workflows is therefore fundamental to reproducible e-Science. However, the ability to record all the required details so as to make a workflow fully reproducible is a long-standing problem that is very difficult to solve. In this paper, we introduce an approach that integrates system description, source control, container management and automatic deployment techniques to facilitate workflow reproducibility. We have developed a framework that leverages this integration to support workflow execution, re-execution and reproducibility in the cloud and in a personal computing environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by ex-amining various aspects of repeatability and reproducibility on real scientific workflows. The framework allows workflow andtask images to be captured automatically, which improves not only repeatability but also runtime performance. It also gives workflows portability across different cloud environments. Finally, the framework can also track changes in the development of tasks and workflows to protect them from unintentional failures.

  We know now that much health and medical research which is published in peer-reviewed journals is wrong,[1] and consequently much is unable to be replicated.[2-4] This is due in part to poor research practice, biases in publication, and simply a pressure to publish in order to ‘survive’. Cognitive biases that unreasonably wed to our hypotheses and results are to blame.[5] Strongly embedded in our culture of health and medical research is the natural selection of poor science practice driven by the dependence for survival on high rates of publication in academic life. It is a classic form of cultural evolution along Darwinian lines.[6, 7] Do not think that even publications in the most illustrious medical journal are immune from these problems: the COMPare project[8] reveals that more than 85% of large randomised controlled trials deviate seriously from their plan when the trial was registered prior to its start. An average of more than five new outcome measures was secretly added to the publication and a similar number of nominated outcomes were silently omitted. It is hardly far-fetched to propose that this drive to publish is contributing to the growth in the number of papers retracted from the literature for dubious conduct[9] along with the increasing number of cases of research misconduct.

  Psychology has a replication problem. Since 2010, scientists conducting replications of hundreds of studies have discovered that a dismal amount of published results can be reproduced. This realization by psychologists has come to be known as "replication crisis". For me, this story all started with ego-depletion, and the comics I had drawn about it in 2014. The idea is that your self-control is a resource that can be diminished with use. When you think about all the times you've been slowly worn down by temptation, it seems obvious. When I drew the comics, there had been new research pointing to blood sugar levels as the font of self-control from which we all drew from. It also made sense—people get cranky when they're hungry. We even made up a word for it. We call it being "hangry".

  The biomedical research sciences are currently facing a challenge highlighted in several recent publications: concerns about the rigor and reproducibility of studies published in the scientific literature.Research progress is strongly dependent on published work. Basic science researchers build on their own prior work and the published findings of other researchers. This work becomes the foundation for preclinical and clinical research aimed at developing innovative new diagnostic tools and disease therapies. At each of the stages of research, scientific rigor and reproducibility are critical, and the financial and ethical stakes rise as drug development research moves through these stages.

  Science progresses by an iterative process whereby discoveries build upon a foundation of established facts and principles. The integrity of the advancement of knowledge depends crucially on the reliability and reproducibility of our published results. Although mistakes and falsification of results have always been an unfortunate part of the process, most viewed scientific research as self-correcting; the incorrect results and conclusions would inevitably be challenged and replaced with more reliable information. But what happens if the process is corrupted by systematic errors brought about by the misapplication of statistics, the use of unreliable reagents and inappropriate cell models, and the pressure to publish in the most selective venues? We may be facing this scenario now in areas of biomedical science in which claims have been made that a majority of the most important work in, for example, cancer biology is not reproducible in the hands of drug companies that would seek to rely on the biomedical literature for opportunities in drug discovery.

  Adhering faithfully to the scientific method is at the very heart of psychological inquiry. It requires scientists to be passionately dispassionate, to be intensely interested in scientific questions but not wedded to the answers. It asks that scientists not personally identify with their past work or theories — even those that bear their names — so that science as a whole can inch ever closer to illuminating elusive truths. That compliance isn’t so easy. But those who champion the so-called replication revolution in psychological science believe that it is possible — with the right structural reforms and personal incentives.

  Early in my Ph.D. studies, my supervisor assigned me the task of running computer code written by a previous student who was graduated and gone. It was hell. I had to sort through many different versions of the code, saved in folders with a mysterious numbering scheme. There was no documentation and scarcely an explanatory comment in the code itself. It took me at least a year to run the code reliably, and more to get results that reproduced those in my predecessor's thesis. Now that I run my own lab, I make sure that my students don't have to go through that.

Yet in computational hydrology, the code and data that actually produces published results is not regularly made available, inhibiting the ability of the community to reproduce and verify previous findings. In order to overcome this problem we recommend that re-useable code and formal workflows, which unambiguously reproduce published scientific results, are made available for the community alongside data, so that we can verify previous findings, and build directly from previous work. In cases where reproducing large-scale hydrologic studies is computationally very expensive and time-consuming, new processes are required to ensure scientific rigour. Such changes will strongly improve the transparency of hydrological research, and thus provide a more credible foundation for scientific advancement and policy support.

  Reproducibility and replicability of rodent phenotyping in preclinical studies

  The scientific community is increasingly concerned with cases of published "discoveries" that are not replicated in further studies. The field of mouse phenotyping was one of the first to raise this concern, and to relate it to other complicated methodological issues: the complex interaction between genotype and environment; the definitions of behavioral constructs; and the use of the mouse as a model animal for human health and disease mechanisms. In January 2015, researchers from various disciplines including genetics, behavior genetics, neuroscience, ethology, statistics and bioinformatics gathered in Tel Aviv University to discuss these issues. The general consent presented here was that the issue is prevalent and of concern, and should be addressed at the statistical, methodological and policy levels, but is not so severe as to call into question the validity and the usefulness of the field as a whole. Well-organized community efforts, coupled with improved data and metadata sharing were agreed by all to have a key role to play in view of identifying specific problems, as well as promoting effective solutions. As replicability is related to validity and may also affect generalizability and translation of findings, the implications of the present discussion reach far beyond the issue of replicability of mouse phenotypes but may be highly relevant throughout biomedical research.

  A scientific result is not truly established until it is independently confirmed. This is one of the tenets of experimental science. Yet, we have seen a rash of recent headlines about experimental results that could not be reproduced. In the biomedical field, efforts to reproduce results of academic research by drug companies have had less than a 50% success rate,a resulting in billions of dollars in wasted effort. In most cases the cause is not intentional fraud, but rather sloppy research protocols and faulty statistical analysis. Nevertheless, this has led to both a loss in public confidence in the scientific enterprise and some serious soul searching within certain fields. Publishers have begun to take the lead in insisting on more careful reporting and review, as well as facilitating government open science initiatives mandating sharing of research data and code. To support efforts of this type, the ACM Publications Board recently approved a new policy on Result and Artifact Review and Badging. This policy defines two badges ACM will use to highlight papers that have undergone independent verification. Results Replicated is applied when the paper's main results have been replicated using artifacts provided by the author, or Results Reproduced if done completely independently.

  When graduate student Alyssa Ward took a science-policy internship, she expected to learn about policy — not to unearth gaps in her biomedical training. She was compiling a bibliography about the reproducibility of experiments, and one of the papers, a meta-analysis, found that scientists routinely fail to explain how they choose the number of samples to use in a study. "My surprise was not about the omission — it was because I had no clue how, or when, to calculate sample size," Ward says. Nor had she ever been taught about major categories of experimental design, or the limitations of P values. (Although they can help to judge the strength of scientific evidence, P values do not — as many think — estimate the likelihood that a hypothesis is true.)

  The Solution to Science's Replication Crisis

  The solution to science's replication crisis is a new ecosystem in which scientists sell what they learn from their research. In each pairwise transaction, the information seller makes (loses) money if he turns out to be correct (incorrect). Responsibility for the determination of correctness is delegated, with appropriate incentives, to the information purchaser. Each transaction is brokered by a central exchange, which holds money from the anonymous information buyer and anonymous information seller in escrow, and which enforces a set of incentives facilitating the transfer of useful, bluntly honest information from the seller to the buyer. This new ecosystem, capitalist science, directly addresses socialist science's replication crisis by explicitly rewarding accuracy and penalizing inaccuracy.

However, experimental mobile and wireless research is still hindered by the lack of a solid framework to adequately evaluate the performance of a wide variety of techniques and protocols proposed by the community. In this talk, I will motivate the need for experimental reproducibility as a necessary aspect for healthy progress as accepted by other communities. I will illustrate how other research communities went through similar processes. I will then present the unique challenges of mobile and wireless experimentation, and discuss approaches, past, current, and future to address these challenges. Finally, I will discuss how reproducibility extends to mobile and wireless security research.

  It seems like the most elementary of research principles: Make sure the cells and reagents in your experiment are what they claim to be and behave as expected. But when it comes to antibodies—the immune proteins used in all kinds of experiments to tag a molecule of interest in a sample—that validation process is not straightforward. Research antibodies from commercial vendors are often screened and optimized for narrow experimental conditions, which means they may not work as advertised for many scientists. Indeed, problems with antibodies are thought to have led many drug developers astray and generated a host of misleading or irreproducible scientific results.

  AN INTERNATIONAL INTER-LABORATORY DIGITAL PCR STUDY DEMONSTRATES HIGH REPRODUCIBILITY FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF A RARE SEQUENCE VARIANT

  This study tested the claim that digital PCR (dPCR) can offer highly reproducible quantitative measurements in disparate labs. Twenty-one laboratories measured four blinded samples containing different quantities of a KRAS fragment encoding G12D, an important genetic marker for guiding therapy of certain cancers. This marker is challenging to quantify reproducibly using qPCR or NGS due to the presence of competing wild type sequences and the need for calibration. Using dPCR, eighteen laboratories were able to quantify the G12D marker within 12% of each other in all samples. Three laboratories appeared to measure consistently outlying results; however, proper application of a follow-up analysis recommendation rectified their data. Our findings show that dPCR has demonstrable reproducibility across a large number of laboratories without calibration and could enable the reproducible application of molecular stratification to guide therapy, and potentially for molecular diagnostics.

  Developing effective information retrieval models has been a long standing challenge in Information Retrieval (IR), and significant progresses have been made over the years. With the increasing number of developed retrieval functions and the release of new data collections, it becomes more difficult, if not impossible, to compare a new retrieval function with all existing retrieval functions over all available data collections. To tackle thisproblem, this paper describes our efforts on constructing a platform that aims to improve the reproducibility of IR researchand facilitate the evaluation and comparison of retrieval functions.

  There’s been a lot of discussion across many scientific fields about the "reproducibility crisis" in the past few years. Hundreds of psychologists attempted to redo 100 studies as part of the Reproducibility Project in Psychology, and claimed that fewer than half of the replication attempts succeeded. In Biomedicine, a study from the biotech firm Amgen tried to re-create results of 53 "landmark" preclinical cancer studies, and only got the same results for six of them. Amid a growing concern about research reliability, funders including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have called for a greater effort to make research reproducible through transparent reporting of the methods researchers use to conduct their investigations.

  Many scientists worry over the reproducibility of wet-lab experiments, but data scientist Victoria Stodden's focus is on how to validate computational research: analyses that can involve thousands of lines of code and complex data sets. Beginning this month, Stodden — who works at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign — becomes one of three ‘reproducibility editors’ appointed to look over code and data sets submitted by authors to the Applications and Case Studies (ACS) section of the Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA). Other journals including Nature have established guidelines for accommodating data requests after publication, but they rarely consider the availability of code and data during the review of a manuscript. JASA ACS will now insist that — with a few exceptions for privacy — authors submit this information as a condition of publication.

  This article describes a series of experiments on gender attribution of Polish texts. The research was conducted on the publicly available corpus called "He Said She Said", consisting of a large number of short texts from the Polish version of Common Crawl. As opposed to other experiments on gender attribution, this research takes on a task of classifying relatively short texts, authored by many different people. For the sake of this work, the original "He Said She Said" corpus was filtered in order to eliminate noise and apparent errors in the training data. In the next step, various machine learning algorithms were developed in order to achieve better classification accuracy. Interestingly, the results of the experiments presented in this paper are fully reproducible, as all the source codes were deposited in the open platform Gonito.net. Gonito.net allows for defining machine learning tasks to be tackled by multiple researchers and provides the researchers with easy access to each other’s results.

  Conducting Reproducible Research with Umbrella: Tracking, Creating, and Preserving Execution Environments

  Publishing scientific results without the detailed execution environments describing how the results were collected makes it difficult or even impossible for the reader to reproduce thework. However, the configurations of the execution environ-ments are too complex to be described easily by authors. To solve this problem, we propose a framework facilitating the conduct of reproducible research by tracking, creating, and preserving the comprehensive execution environments with Umbrella. The framework includes a lightweight, persistent anddeployable execution environment specification, an execution engine which creates the specified execution environments, and an archiver which archives an execution environment into persistent storage services like Amazon S3 and Open Science Framework (OSF). The execution engine utilizes sandbox techniques like virtual machines (VMs), Linux containers and user-space tracers, to cre-ate an execution environment, and allows common dependencies like base OS images to be shared by sandboxes for different applications. We evaluate our framework by utilizing it to reproduce three scientific applications from epidemiology, scene rendering, and high energy physics. We evaluate the time and space overhead of reproducing these applications, and the effectiveness of the chosen archive unit and mounting mechanism for allowing different applications to share dependencies. Our results show that these applications can be reproduced using different sandbox techniques successfully and efficiently, even through the overhead andperformance slightly vary.

  Computing as a whole suffers from a crisis of reproducibility. Programs executed in one context are aston-ishingly hard to reproduce in another context, resulting in wasted effort by people and general distrust of results produced by computer. The root of the problem lies in the fact that every program has implicit dependencies on data and execution environment whichare rarely understood by the end user. To address this problem, we present PRUNE, the Preserving Run Environment.In PRUNE, every task to be executed is wrapped in a functional interface and coupled with a strictly defined environment. The task is then executed by PRUNErather than the user to ensure reproducibility. As a scientific workflow evolves in PRUNE, a growing but immutable tree of derived data is created. The provenance of every item in the system can be precisely described, facilitating sharing and modification between collaborating researchers, along with efficient management of limited storage space. We present the user interface and the initial prototype of PRUNE, and demonstrate its application in matching records and comparing surnames in U.S. Censuses.

  This commentary provides a brief history of the U.S. funding initiatives associated with promoting multiscale modeling of the physiome since 2003. An effort led in the United States is the Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG) Multiscale Modeling Consortium (MSM). Though IMAG and the MSM have generated much interest in developing MSM models of the physiome, challenges associated with model and data sharing in biomedical, biological and behavioral systems still exist. Since 2013, the IEEE EMBS Technical Committee on Computational Biology and the Physiome (CBaP TC) has supported discussions on promoting model reproducibility through publication. This Special Issue on Model Sharing and Reproducibility is a realization of the CBaP TC discussions. Though open questions remain on how we can further facilitate model reproducibility, accessibility and reuse by the worldwide community for different biomedical domain applications, this special issue provides a unique demonstration of both the challenges and opportunities for publishing reproducible computational models.

These recommendations constitute an actionable framework that, in combination, could improve the quality of biological research.

  Scientists, public servants, and patient advocates alike increasingly question the validity of published scientific results, endangering the public’s acceptance of science. Here, I argue that emerging flaws in the integrity of the peer review system are largely responsible. Distortions in peer review are driven by economic forces and enabled by a lack of accountability of journals, editors, and authors. One approach to restoring trust in the validity of published results may be to establish basic rules that render peer review more transparent, such as publishing the reviews (a practice already embraced by some journals) and monitoring not only the track records of authors but also of editors and journals.

We have retooled or created from scratch multiple courses that engage something few of my colleagues seem to consider relevant to the problem: intellectual history. They instead hold firmly to the dictates of positivism, insisting that better training in the methods of science will be the source of rescue. Where does this prejudice come from?

  A major contributor to the scientific reproducibility crisis has been that the results from homogeneous, single-center studies do not generalize to heterogeneous, real world populations. Multi-cohort gene expression analysis has helped to increase reproducibility by aggregating data from diverse populations into a single analysis. To make the multi-cohort analysis process more feasible, we have assembled an analysis pipeline which implements rigorously studied meta-analysis best practices. We have compiled and made publicly available the results of our own multi-cohort gene expression analysis of 103 diseases, spanning 615 studies and 36,915 samples, through a novel and interactive web application. As a result, we have made both the process of and the results from multi-cohort gene expression analysis more approachable for non-technical users.

  To make replication studies more useful, researchers must make more of them, funders must encourage them and journals must publish them.No scientist wants to be the first to try to replicate another’s promising study: much better to know what happened when others tried it. Long before replication or reproducibility became major talking points, scientists had strategies to get the word out. Gossip was one. Researchers would compare notes at conferences, and a patchy network would be warned about whether a study was worth building on. Or a vague comment might be buried in a related publication. Tell-tale sentences would start "In our hands", "It is unclear why our results differed …" or "Interestingly, our results did not …".

description: |
  The latest policy developments require immediate action for data preservation, as well as reproducible and Open Science. To address this, an unprecedented digital library service is presented to enable the High-Energy Physics community to preserve and share their research objects (such as data, code, documentation, notes) throughout their research process. While facing the challenges of a “big data” community, the internal service builds on existing internal databases to make the process as easy and intrinsic as possible for researchers. Given the “work in progress” nature of the objects preserved, versioning is supported. It is expected that the service will not only facilitate better preservation techniques in the community, but will foremost make collaborative research easier as detailed metadata and novel retrieval functionality provide better access to ongoing works. This new type of e-infrastructure, fully integrated into the research workflow, could help in fostering Open Science practices across disciplines.

description: |
  Two weeks ago (1st-4th of August 2016) we hosted a coding sprint at Stanford aimed at making neuroimaging data processing and analysis tools more portable and accessible. You might have heard about BIDS – it is a new standard for organizing and describing neuroimaging datasets that we have recently proposed. Containers (also known as “operating-system-level virtualization”) are very lightweight virtual machines that can encapsulate any piece of code along with all of the libraries necessary to run it. Docker and Singularity are two examples of container technologies. The reason we are so excited about containers for reproducible data analysis is that they provide a way to package a piece of software which can run in the same way across many different computing platforms, from a laptop to a supercomputer. Creating containerized and BIDS-aware versions of all of the major neuroimaging analysis packages is critical to our center’s mission: providing data analysis as an free and open service to incentivize researchers to share data.

  If you are an R user it has probably happened to you that you upgraded some R package in your R installation, and then suddenly your R script or application stopped working. One strategy is that you create a new package library for a new project. A package library is just a directory that holds all installed R packages. (In addition to the ones that are installed with R itself.) This is why we created the pkgsnap tool. This is a very simple package with two exported functions: 1) snap takes a snapshot of your project library. It writes out the names and versions of the currently installed packages into a text file. You can put this text file into the version control repository of the project, to make sure it is not lost, and 2) restore uses the snapshot file to recreate the package project library from scratch. It installs the recorded versions of the recorded packages, in the right order.

  Reproducibility is receiving increased attention across many domains of science and genomics is no exception. Efforts to identify copy number variations (CNVs) from exome sequence (ES) data have been increasing. Many algorithms have been published to discover CNVs from exomes and a major challenge is the reproducibility in other datasets. Here we test exome CNV calling reproducibility under three conditions: data generated by different sequencing centers; varying sample sizes; and varying capture methodology.

  Everyone agrees that reproducibility and replicability are fundamental characteristics of scientific studies. These topics are attracting increasing attention, scrutiny, and debate both in the popular press and the scientific literature. But there are no formal statistical definitions for these concepts, which leads to confusion since the same words are used for different concepts by different people in different fields. We provide formal and informal definitions of scientific studies, reproducibility, and replicability that can be used to clarify discussions around these concepts in the scientific and popular press.

  Reproducibility of data from experimental investigations using animal models is increasingly under scrutiny because of the potentially negative impact of poor reproducibility on the translation of basic research. Histopathology is a key tool in biomedical research, in particular for the phenotyping of animal models to provide insights into the pathobiology of diseases. Failure to disclose and share crucial histopathological experimental details compromises the validity of the review process and reliability of the conclusions. We discuss factors that affect the interpretation and validation of histopathology data in publications and the importance of making these data accessible to promote replicability in research.

  When functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was introduced in the late 1990s, it drew raves for its ability to show brain activity—and concerns that it might be the modern equivalent of phrenology. Now, that debate could spring to life again with revelations that the popular imaging technology could have been flawed for years. As Kate Lunau writes for Motherboard, new research suggests that software used to analyze fMRI results could invalidate up to 40,000 brain activity studies.

  Data from RNA-seq experiments provide us with many new possibilities to gain insights into biological and disease mechanisms of cellular functioning. However, the reproducibility and robustness of RNA-seq data analysis results is often unclear. This is in part attributed to the two counter acting goals of (a) a cost efficient and (b) an optimal experimental design leading to a compromise, e.g., in the sequencing depth of experiments.

  A whole pile of "this is how your brain looks like" MRI-based science has been invalidated because someone finally got around to checking the data. The problem is simple: to get from a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain to a scientific conclusion, the brain is divided into tiny "voxels." Software, rather than humans, then scans the voxels looking for clusters. In this paper at PNAS, they write: "the most common software packages for fMRI analysis (SPM, FSL, AFNI) can result in false-positive rates of up to 70%. These results question the validity of some 40,000 fMRI studies and may have a large impact on the interpretation of neuroimaging results."

  Connectome hubs at resting state in children and adolescents: Reproducibility and psychopathological correlation.

tags: [reproducible paper]
description: |
  Functional brain hubs are key integrative regions in brain networks. Recently, brain hubs identified through resting-state fMRI have emerged as interesting targets to increase understanding of the relationships between large-scale functional networks and psychopathology. However, few studies have directly addressed the replicability and consistency of the hub regions identified and their association with symptoms. Here, we used the eigenvector centrality (EVC) measure obtained from graph analysis of two large, independent population-based samples of children and adolescents (7-15 years old; total N=652; 341 subjects for site 1 and 311 for site 2) to evaluate the replicability of hub identification. Subsequently, we tested the association between replicable hub regions and psychiatric symptoms. We identified a set of hubs consisting of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule/intraparietal sulcus (IPL/IPS). Moreover, lower EVC values in the right IPS were associated with psychiatric symptoms in both samples. Thus, low centrality of the IPS was a replicable sign of potential vulnerability to mental disorders in children. The identification of critical and replicable hubs in functional cortical networks in children and adolescents can foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying mental disorders.

But not any more: both the popular media and the journals themselves have been trying to deal with the topic, amid reports that far too many results can’t be replicated. Large scale efforts have begun to examine key papers in experimental psychology, among other areas. Reports from the biopharma industry about the numbers of interesting biology papers that don’t hold up have stirred alarm as well. But as far as I can tell, chemistry has largely escaped the current rounds of criticism.

  Reproducibility: Crisis or Not?

  Here are the results of a Nature survey on reproducibility in the scientific literature. They themselves admit that it’s a "confusing snapshot", but it shows that we're still arguing about what "reproducibility" means. 52% of the responders (over 1500 scientists) said that there was "a significant crisis", though, so this issue is on people’s minds. Interestingly, chemists were among the most confidant in the literature of their own field (physics and engineering as well). At the same time, chemists had the highest proportion of respondents who said that they'd been unable to reproduce someone else's experiment. I don't think that's necessarily a contradiction, though. Chemistry is a field with lower barriers to replication than many others, and we also probably do more replications in general.

  Money back guarantees for non-reproducible results?

  Money back guarantees are generally unheard of in biomedicine and healthcare. Recently, the US provider Geisenger Health System, in Pennsylvania, started a programme to give patients their money back if they were dissatisfied. That came as quite a surprise. Soon thereafter, the chief medical officer at Merck launched an even bigger one, proposing an "incentive-based approach" to non-reproducible results—what he termed a "reproducibility crisis" that "threatens the entire biomedical research enterprise."

  More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from Nature's survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research. The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

  Contextual sensitivity in scientific reproducibility

description: |
  Scientific progress requires that findings can be reproduced by other scientists. However, there is widespread debate in psychology (and other fields) about how to interpret failed replications. Many have argued that contextual factors might account for several of these failed replications. We analyzed 100 replication attempts in psychology and found that the extent to which the research topic was likely to be contextually sensitive (varying in time, culture, or location) was associated with replication success. This relationship remained a significant predictor of replication success even after adjusting for characteristics of the original and replication studies that previously had been associated with replication success (e.g., effect size, statistical power). We offer recommendations for psychologists and other scientists interested in reproducibility.

description: |
  We report that publication guidelines focus more on other potential sources of bias in experimental results, under-appreciate the potential for pain and pain drugs to skew data, and thus mostly treat pain management as solely an animal welfare concern, in the jurisdiction of animal care and use committees. At the same time, animal welfare regulations do not include guidance on publishing animal data, even though publication is an integral part of the cycle of research and can affect the welfare of animals in studies building on published work, leaving it to journals and authors to voluntarily decide what details of animal use to publish. We suggest that journals, scientists and animal welfare regulators should revise current guidelines and regulations, on treatment of pain and on transparent reporting of treatment of pain, to improve this dual welfare and data-quality deficiency.

  Only mandatory Open Data, not Gold Open Access, will lead to more honest and more reproducible science. Open Science is these days largely about mandatory publishing in Open Access (OA), regardless of the costs to poorer scientists or the universities which already struggle to pay horrendous subscription fees. Meanwhile, publishers openly declare that the so-called Gold (author-pays) OA will be much more expensive than even current subscription rates, yet wealthy western institutions like the Dutch university network VSNU or the German Max Planck Society do not seem troubled by this at all. They seriously expect the publishing oligopoly of Elsevier, SpringerNature and Wiley to lower the costs for Gold OA later on, out of the goodness of their hearts (as this winter’s invitation-only Berlin12 OA conference suggests).

  This Workshop aims at becoming a forum to discuss ideas and advancements towards the revision of current scientific communication practices in order to support Open Science, introduce novel evaluation schemes, and enable reproducibility. As such it candidates as an event fostering collaboration between (i) Library and information scientists working on the identification of new publication paradigms; (ii) ICT scientists involved in the definition of new technical solutions to these issues; (iii) scientists/researchers who actually conduct the research and demand tools and practices for Open Science. The expected results are advancements in the definition of the next generation scientific communication ecosystem, where scientists can publish research results (including the scientific article, the data, the methods, and any “alternative” product that may be relevant to the conducted research) in order to enable reproducibility (effective reuse and decrease of cost of science) and rely on novel scientific reward practices.

  Recent reports in the Washington Post and the Economist, among others, raise the concern that relatively few scientists' experimental findings can be replicated. This is worrying: replicating an experiment is a main foundation of the scientific method. As scientists, we build on knowledge gained and published by others. We develop new experiments and questions based on the knowledge we gain from those published reports. If those papers are valid, our work is supported and knowledge advances. On the other hand, if published research is not actually valid, if it can’t be replicated, it delivers only an incidental finding, not scientific knowledge.

We survey existing work on these topics within economics and discuss the evidence suggesting that publication bias, inability to replicate, and specification searching remain widespread problems in the discipline. We next discuss recent progress in this area, including improved research design, study registration and pre-analysis plans, disclosure standards, and open sharing of data and materials, and draw on experiences in both economics and other social sciences. We discuss areas where consensus is emerging on new practices as well as approaches that remain controversial and speculate about the most effective ways to make economics research more accurate, credible, and reproducible in the future.

  There’s a replication crisis in biomedicine—and no one even knows how deep it runs. Many science funders share Parker’s antsiness over all the waste of time and money. In February, the White House announced its plan to put $1 billion toward a similar objective—a “Cancer Moonshot” aimed at making research more techy and efficient. But recent studies of the research enterprise reveal a more confounding issue, and one that won’t be solved with bigger grants and increasingly disruptive attitudes. The deeper problem is that much of cancer research in the lab—maybe even most of it—simply can’t be trusted. The data are corrupt. The findings are unstable. The science doesn’t work.

  Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals regarding the lack of replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. To avoid a widespread crisis in neuroimaging research and consequent loss of credibility in the public eye, we need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers that will help them make their research more reproducible and transparent while minimizing the additional effort that this might require. The guide covers three major topics in open science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical advice as well as highlighting advantages of adopting more open research practices that go beyond improved transparency and reproducibility.

  Checklists vs. checkmate: Reproducibility key to premium surgery success

description: |
  Traditionally, checkmate is a position in the game of chess in which a player’s king is in check, without a way to remove the threat. The king cannot be captured, so the game ends when the king is checkmated. As a premium surgeon, no one ever wants to be checkmated at any stage of the surgical process, from preoperative to intraoperative to postoperative. Other forms of etymology have suggested checkmate to signify being “ambushed,” a feeling many of us have experienced in our surgical careers. A means to avoiding being a checkmated surgeon is creating “checklists” from the time of the first patient encounter until the final postoperative visit. The process of checklists can bring reproducibility to a surgical process that already yields successful outcomes in a premium surgeon’s practice.

John Ioannidis at Stanford University, US, goes on saying that most of the search results is actually false. Ioannidis is the author of a mathematical model that predicts that the smaller the sample and less stringent are the experimental methodology, definitions, outcomes and statistical analysis, the greater the probability of error. Furthermore, studies that hold financial and other interests or of great impact are also more prone to false results.

  Once again, reproducibility is in the news. Most recently we hear that irreproducibility is irreproducible and thus everything is actually fine. The most recent round was kicked off by a criticism of the Reproducibility Project followed by claim and counter claim on whether one analysis makes more sense than the other. I’m not going to comment on that but I want to tease apart what the disagreement is about, because it shows that the problem with reproducibility goes much deeper than whether or not a particular experiment replicates.

  Benchmarking has proven to be crucial for the investigation of the behavior and performances of a system. However, the choice of relevant benchmarks still remains a challenge. To help the process of comparing and choosing among benchmarks, we propose a solution for automatic benchmark profiling. It computes unified benchmark profiles reflecting benchmarks’ duration, function repartition, stability, CPU efficiency, parallelization and memory usage. It identifies the needed system information for profile computation, collects it from execution traces and produces profiles through efficient and reproducible trace analysis treatments. The paper presents the design, implementation and the evaluation of the approach. The analysis of the kernel trace follows a workflow implemented using the VisTrails tool.

  As science grapples with what some have called a reproducibility crisis, replication studies, which aim to reproduce the results of previous studies, have been held up as a way to make science more reliable. It seems like common sense: Take a study and do it again — if you get the same result, that’s evidence that the findings are true, and if the result doesn’t turn up again, they’re false. Yet in practice, it’s nowhere near this simple.

The purpose is to create dynamic reports, which can be updated automatically if data or analysis change. Instead of inserting a prefabricated graph or table into the report, the master document contains the R code necessary to obtain it. When run through R, all data analysis output (tables, graphs, etc.) is created on the fly and inserted into a final latex document. The report can be automatically updated if data or analysis change, which allows for truly reproducible research. It does not, however, track provenance.

  When reporting research findings, scientists document the steps they followed so that others can verify and build upon the research. When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches.

  The scientific community is bustling with projects to make published results more reliable. Efforts are under way to establish checklists, to revamp training in experimental design, and even to fund disinterested scientists to replicate others' experiments. A more efficient strategy would be to rework current incentives to put less emphasis on high-impact publications, but those systems are entrenched, and public funders and universities are ill-prepared for that scale of change. To catalyse change, industry must step up to the plate. I have learned this first hand, as head of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), a research charity funded by business, government and other charities. If more companies contributed funds and expertise to efforts such as ours, I believe it would create a system that rewards science that is both cutting-edge and reproducible.

  In 2005, John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, published a paper, “Why most published research findings are false,” mathematically showing that a huge number of published papers must be incorrect. He also looked at a number of well-regarded medical research findings, and found that, of 34 that had been retested, 41% had been contradicted or found to be significantly exaggerated. Since then, researchers in several scientific areas have consistently struggled to reproduce major results of prominent studies. By some estimates, at least 51%—and as much as 89%—of published papers are based on studies and experiments showing results that cannot be reproduced.

  The reproducibility of scientific findings has been called into question. To contribute data about reproducibility in economics, we replicate 18 studies published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2011-2014. All replications follow predefined analysis plans publicly posted prior to the replications, and have a statistical power of at least 90% to detect the original effect size at the 5% significance level. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 11 replications (61%); on average the replicated effect size is 66% of the original. The reproducibility rate varies between 67% and 78% for four additional reproducibility indicators, including a prediction market measure of peer beliefs.

This goal will become easier if we recognise the valuable contribution that software makes to research and reward those people who invest their time into developing reliable and reproducible software.

  In August 2015, a team of 270 researchers reported the largest ever single-study audit of the scientific literature. Led by Brian Nosek, executive director of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Reproducibility Project attempted to replicate studies in 100 psychology papers. According to one of several measures of reproducibility, just 36% could be confirmed; by another statistical measure, 47% could. Not so fast, says Gilbert. Because of the way the Reproducibility Project was conducted, its results say little about the overall reliability of the psychology papers it tried to validate, he argues. "The number of studies that actually did fail to replicate is about the number you would expect to fail to replicate by chance alone — even if all the original studies had shown true effects."

  Our working definition for reproducible research is that a research result can be replicated by another investigator. Our focus is data science and the reproducibility of computational studies and/or analysis of digital data. This note summarizes best practices to facilitate reproducible research in data science (and computational science more generally). It is expected that all research conducted with funding from the DSE will be performed in accordance with these guidelines to the extent possible.

  ACM SIGMOD 2016 Reproducibility Guidelines

tags: [reproducibility guidelines]
description: |
  SIGMOD Reproducibility has three goals: Highlight the impact of database research papers; Enable easy dissemination of research results; Enable easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In short, the goal is to assist in building culture where sharing results, code, and scripts of database research is the norm rather than the exception. The challenge is to do this efficiently, which means building technical expertise on how to do better research via creating repeatable and shareable research. The SIGMOD Reproducibility Committee is here to help you with this.

tags: [reproducibility guidelines]
description: |
  Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core features of science, but not always part of daily practice. Journals can increase transparency and reproducibility of research by adopting the TOP Guidelines. TOP includes eight modular standards, each with three levels of increasing stringency. Journals select which of the eight transparency standards they wish to adopt for their journal, and select a level of implementation for the selected standards. These features provide flexibility for adoption depending on disciplinary variation, but simultaneously establish community standards.

  Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals about the lack of replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. To avoid a widespread crisis in our field and consequent loss of credibility in the public eye, we need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers that will help them make their research more reproducible and transparent while minimizing the additional effort that this might require. The guide covers three major topics in open science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical advice as well as highlighting advantages of adopting more open research practices that go beyond improved transparency and reproducibility.

  Over the last decade, there’s been a lot of talk about reproducibility problems in science — about published results that turn out to be false alarms. In fields like psychology, neuroscience, and cell biology, these errors can send scientists down unproductive paths, waste time and money, and pollute headlines with misleading claims. "But I get much more exercised about reproducibility problems in clinical genetics, because those have massive and real-time consequences for thousands of families," says MacArthur.

  While experiments may be published even in a top scientific journal, other researchers who attempt to repeat the same experiments under the same conditions often find contradicting results. As a measure of this, a recent study attempted to reproduce psychology publications and successfully replicated only 39 out of 100 studies. It turns out that excluding sex in experimental design may have contributed to reproducibility issues. Furthermore, sex can also have a biological impact on our scientific understanding and influence how well early biological studies translate into advances in human medicine.

  Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience: A new preprint has been posted to the ArXiv that has very important implications and should be required reading for all fMRI researchers.  Anders Eklund, Tom Nichols, and Hans Knutson applied task fMRI analyses to a large number of resting fMRI datasets, in order to identify the empirical corrected “familywise” Type I error rates observed under the null hypothesis for both voxel-wise and cluster-wise inference.  What they found is shocking: While voxel-wise error rates were valid, nearly all cluster-based parametric methods (except for FSL’s FLAME 1) have greatly inflated familywise Type I error rates.  This inflation was worst for analyses using lower cluster-forming thresholds (e.g. p=0.01) compared to higher thresholds, but even with higher thresholds there was serious inflation.  This should be a sobering wake-up call for fMRI researchers, as it suggests that the methods used in a large number of previous publications suffer from exceedingly high false positive rates (sometimes greater than 50%).

  According to the mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, who is linked to bioethics through his bioethicist brother Ezekiel Emanuel, "You never let a serious crisis go to waste." In this case the crisis is the reproducibility of published results in the biological and medical sciences. According to a recent comment in Nature, "An unpublished 2015 survey by the American Society for Cell Biology found that more than two-thirds of respondents had on at least one occasion been unable to reproduce published results. Biomedical researchers from drug companies have reported that one-quarter or fewer of high-profile papers are reproducible."

  Massive Study Reports Challenges in Reproducing Published Psychology Findings

tags: [replication study, news article]
description: |
  A study that sought to replicate 100 findings published in three prominent psychology journals has found that, across multiple criteria, independent researchers could replicate less than half of the original findings. In some cases this may call into question the validity of some scientific findings, but it may also point to the difficulty of conducting effective replications and achieving reproducible results.

  Research findings advance science only if they are significant, reliable and reproducible. Scientists and journals must publish robust data in a way that renders it optimally reproducible. Reproducibility has to be incentivized and supported by the research infrastructure but without dampening innovation.

  Junk science? Most preclinical cancer studies don't replicate

description: |
  When a cancer study is published in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal, the implication is the findings are robust, replicable, and point the way toward eventual treatments. Consequently, researchers scour their colleagues' work for clues about promising avenues to explore. Doctors pore over the pages, dreaming of new therapies coming down the pike. Which makes a new finding that nine out of 10 preclinical peer-reviewed cancer research studies cannot be replicated all the more shocking and discouraging.

  Research at Duke University in genomics that involved fighting cancer by looking for gene patterns that would determine which drugs would best attack a particular cancer (no more trial-and-error treatment, considered a breakthrough). This research turned out to be wrong, due to flaws in the research (found by statisticians); if the research was reproducible, errors could have been found earlier and the patients could have continued their treatment.

  NY article discussing the issues with scientific reproducibility: "Why? One simple answer is that it takes a lot of time to look back over other scientists’ work and replicate their experiments. Scientists are busy people, scrambling to get grants and tenure. As a result, papers that attract harsh criticism may nonetheless escape the careful scrutiny required if they are to be refuted."
